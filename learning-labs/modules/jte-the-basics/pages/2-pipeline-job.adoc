= Write the Template

In JTE, instead of creating application-specific `Jenkinsfiles` we create pipeline templates that represent the business logic of a pipeline in a tool-agnostic way.

== Create a Pipeline Job

To demonstrate this, first create a `Pipeline` job.

. From the Jenkins home page, navigate to `New Item` in the lefthand navigation menu.
. Enter a name for the job to be created
. Select `Pipeline` from the list of available job types
. Click `OK`

== Write the Template

=== Overview

For this lab, let's create a pipeline that can build an artifact with maven and then perform static code analysis with SonarQube.

Scroll down on the job's configuration page to the `Pipeline` configuration section.

Make sure that `Jenkins Templating Engine` is selected in the `Definition` drop down configuration option.

Check the box for `Provide default pipeline template (Jenkinsfile)`.

In the `Jenkinsfile` text box, enter:

[source,groovy]
----
build()
static_code_analysis() 
----

[NOTE]
====
A word on vocabulary: The entire script above is called a *Pipeline Template*. Pipeline Templates invoke *steps*, in this case build & static_code_analysis, that are implemented by *libraries*.
====

You can click `Apply` to save your progress. In the next section we'll be creating the pipeline libraries that implement the `build()` and `static_code_analysis()` steps.
