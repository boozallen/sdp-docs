= Configuring Jenkins

In the last section, we ran a local Jenkins instance via Docker and validated it's running on `http://localhost:8080`.

Now, we're going to configure that Jenkins instance by:

* Entering the initial admin password
* Installing the default suggested plugins
* Installing the Jenkins Templating Engine
* Installing the Docker Pipeline plugin

== Initial Admin Password

There are _two_ ways to get the initial admin password for Jenkins.

=== 1. Cat the file

The initial admin password is stored in `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword` within the container.

You can print this password in your terminal by running: `docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

Copy and paste this password into the text box in Jenkins.

[NOTE]
====
If you're using a mac, I'd recommend running `docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword | pbcopy` which will automatically insert the password into your clipboard for pasting.
====

=== 2. Fetch it from the container logs

The initial admin password is also printed to standard out while Jenkins starts up. To view the Jenkins logs, run `docker logs jenkins`.

In the output, you should see something similar to this:

Copy and paste the password into the text box in Jenkins.

== Installing the Suggested Plugins

After entering the initial admin password, Jenkins will bring you to a _Customize Jenkins_ page.

Click the `Install suggested plugins` button.

This will bring you to a loading screen displaying the progress as Jenkins installs the most popular community plugins.

== Setup Initial Admin User

After the plugins are done installing, Jenkins will send you to a screen to configure the default admin user.

Feel free to create a custom username and password or continue as admin.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you click "continue as admin" then the username will be `admin` and the password will be the initial admin password we found earlier.
====

== Instance Configuration

After creating the initial admin user, Jenkins will send you to a screen where you can configure the instance's URL. The text box will be prepopulated with what's currently in your browser, so click _Save and Finish_ in the bottom righthand side of the screen.

== Installing the Jenkins Templating Engine

At this point, you've completed the Jenkins Startup Wizard process. Click "_Start Using Jenkins_" and you will be directed to the Jenkins home page.

Now, we're going to install the Jenkins Templating Engine, which can be found as the `Templating Engine Plugin` in the Jenkins Update Center.

. In the lefthand navigation menu, select _Manage Jenkins_
. In the middle of the screen, Select _Manage Plugins_
. Select the _Available_ tab at the top
. In the upper right _Filter_ text box, type: `Templating Engine`

At this point you should see:

Make sure to select the Templating Engine Plugin and click "_Download now and install after restart_".

This will direct you to a screen showing the download progress of JTE.

The plugin will not become active until you select "_Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running_".

At this point, Jenkins will restart automatically. Log in again with either the custom admin user you created earlier or the initial admin password.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can run `docker logs -f jenkins` to see the Jenkins logs. It will say "Jenkins is fully up and running" when Jenkins has completed the restart and is ready to be interacted with.
====

== Installing the Docker Pipeline plugin

Now, we need to install the Docker Pipeline plugin, which can be found as the `Docker Pipeline` in the Jenkins Update Center.

. In the lefthand navigation menu, select _Manage Jenkins_
. In the middle of the screen, Select _Manage Plugins_
. Select the _Available_ tab at the top
. In the upper right _Filter_ text box, type: `Docker Pipeline`

Follow the same steps used for installing the jenkins templating engine and restart the Jenkins instance.
