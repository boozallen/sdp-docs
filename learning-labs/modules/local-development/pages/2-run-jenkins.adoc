= Run the Jenkins Container

Docker simplifies packaging applications with all their dependencies.

Through Docker, we can have a running Jenkins instance in a matter of seconds. 

In your terminal, first build a jenkins image with docker installed. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following:

[source,]
----
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add
RUN add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io 
EXPOSE 8080
----

From the same directory as your Dockerfile, build the image:
[source,]
----
docker build -t jenkins:lts-docker .
----

[NOTE]
====
Running Jenkins as a docker container on a BAH managed machine requires specific certificates and tooling to be installed. A Dockerfile meeting these requirements can be built from the solutions-delivery-platform/bah-jenkins repo available internally.
====

Then, to start jenkins, run:

(If running Docker for Windows, please refer to Important section below)

[source,]
----
    docker run --name jenkins \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --privileged \
    --user root \
    -p 50000:50000 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -d \
    jenkins:lts-docker
----

.Command Line Breakdown
|===
| Command Section | Description

| docker run
| Tells docker to going to run a container image

| --name jenkins
| Names the container being launched `jenkins`. This is done for ease of referencing it later.

| -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
| Mounts the local docker daemon socket to the Jenkins container.

| –privileged
| Escalates the container permissions so it can launch containers on the host docker daemon

| –user root
| Runs the container as the root user so it can launch containers on the host docker daemon

| -p 50000:50000
| Port forwarding of the default JNLP agent port to our localhost

| -p 8080:8080
| Port forwading of the Jenkins Console port to our localhost

| -d
| Runs the container process in the background

| jenkins/jenkins:lts
| The container image from which to run this container

|===

[NOTE]
====
If port 8080 is already in use by another process then this command will fail.  To run Jenkins on a different port, swap out the first 8080 to your desired port: ``<desired port number>:8080``.  
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Windows OS: When using Docker for Windows, use the following command to run the Jenkins container: 

[source,]
----
    docker run --name jenkins \
    -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
    --privileged \
    --user root \
    -p 50000:50000 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -d \
    jenkins:lts-docker
----

You can run ``docker logs -f jenkins`` to see the Jenkins logs.  It will say "Jenkins is fully up and running" when Jenkins is ready.

====

You can validate the container launched as expected by going to ``http://localhost:8080``. 

You should see the Jenkins Startup Wizard:

In the next section, we'll learn how to get past this Startup Wizard and configure the newly deployed Jenkins instance.
