= Run the Jenkins Container

Docker simplifies packaging applications with all their dependencies.

Through Docker, we can have a running Jenkins instance in a matter of seconds. 

In your terminal, run: 

(If running Docker for Windows, please refer to Important section below)

[source,]
----
    docker run --name jenkins \
    -v $(which docker):/usr/local/bin/docker \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --privileged \
    --user root \
    -p 50000:50000 \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -d \
    jenkins/jenkins:lts

.Command Line Breakdown
|===
| Command Section | Description

| docker run
| Tells docker to going to run a container image

| --name jenkins
| Names the container being launched `jenkins`. This is done for ease of referencing it later.

| -v $(which docker):/usr/local/bin/docker
| Mounts the local docker executable to the Jenkins container, since docker is not installed in the container.

| -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
| Mounts the local docker daemon socket to the Jenkins container.

| –privileged
| Escalates the container permissions so it can launch containers on the host docker daemon

| –user root
| Runs the container as the root user so it can launch containers on the host docker daemon

| -p 50000:50000
| Port forwarding of the default JNLP agent port to our localhost

| -p 8080:8080
| Port forwading of the Jenkins Console port to our localhost

| -d
| Runs the container process in the background

| jenkins/jenkins:lts
| The container image from which to run this container

|===

[NOTE]
====
If port 8080 is already in use by another process then this command will fail.  To run Jenkins on a different port, swap out the first 8080 to your desired port: ``<desired port number>:8080``.  
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Windows OS: When using Docker for Windows, use the following command to run the Jenkins container: 
docker run --name jenkins -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --privileged --user root -p 50000:50000 -p 8080:8080 -d jenkins/jenkins:lts

You can run ``docker logs -f jenkins`` to see the Jenkins logs.  It will say "Jenkins is fully up and running" when Jenkins is ready.

====

You can validate the container launched as expected by going to ``http://localhost:8080``. 

You should see the Jenkins Startup Wizard:

In the next section, we'll learn how to get past this Startup Wizard and configure the newly deployed Jenkins instance.
