= Multi-Method Steps

While learning about Pipeline Lifecycle Hooks, we created a step that:

* implemented multiple methods
* did not implement a `call` method

In this section, we're going to dive into multi-method steps in a little more detail.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Have you ever wondered why library steps create a method named `call`? This is because, in groovy, `something()` gets translated to `something.call()`.
====

If we understand this concept, then it would make sense that we could define other methods within our steps and invoke them by their full name.

== When to use Multi-Method Steps

The most common use case for defining multiple methods inside one step file is when you're creating some utility functionality.

To demonstrate this, let's create a mock `git` utility that can `add`, `commit`, and `push`.

== Create the Git Library

In the same Pipeline Configuration Repository we used for JTE: The Basics, create a `git` library.

Because we're creating a git utility, add a file called `git.groovy` with the contents:

[source,groovy]
----
/*
    takes an arraylist of files to pass to git add 
*/
void add(ArrayList files){
    println "git add ${files.join(" ")}"
}

/*
    takes a string commit message to pass to git commit 
*/
void commit(String message){
    println "git commit -m ${message}" 
}

/*
    performs the git push
*/
void push(){
    println "git push" 
}
----

In this example, we're creating a step that serves as a utility wrapper. These are typically *not* invoked directly by Pipeline Templates but rather consumed by other steps. That is why it is okay, in this case, to accept input parameters for these methods.

We will be invoking this functionality directly from the Pipeline Template to demonstrate its functionality.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The filestructure for your Pipeline Configuration libraries directory should now be:

[source,]

            ├── splunk_pipeline_start.groovy
            └── splunk_step_watcher.groovy

== Update the Pipeline Configuration

Update the Pipeline Configuration to load the `git` library.

The `libraries` portion of the Pipeline Configuration should now be:

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
    maven
    sonarqube
    ansible
    splunk{
        afterSteps = [ "static_code_analysis", "unit_test" ]
    }
    git
}
----

== Use the new Git Utility

Prepend to the existing Pipeline Template:

[source,groovy]
----
git.add(["a", "b", "c"])
git.commit "my commit message" 
git.push()
----

[IMPORTANT]

====
When invoking a non-call method defined within a step, you do so by `<step_name>.<method_name>(<arguments>)`.
====

== Run the Pipeline

Run the pipeline again and you will see logs similar to:
