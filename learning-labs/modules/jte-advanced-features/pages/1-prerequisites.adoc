= Prerequisites

== Jenkins Instance

A Jenkins instance will be required for this lab. If you don't have one available to you, we would recommend going through the `Local Development<Local Development>` learning lab to deploy a local Jenkins instance through Docker.

== JTE: Pipeline Primitives

This lab is the third and final lab specificially dedicated to the Jenkins Templating Engine's functionality.

Please be sure to have completed the xref:learning-labs:jte-primitives:index.adoc[JTE: Pipeline Primitives] lab before attempting this one as we will be picking up where that lab leaves off.
