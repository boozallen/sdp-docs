= Prerequisites

== Jenkins Instance

A Jenkins instance will be required for this lab. If you don't have one available to you, we would recommend going through the xref:local-development:index.adoc[Local Development] learning lab to deploy a local Jenkins instance through Docker.

== JTE: The Basics

This lab continues to build upon our knowledge of the Jenkins Templating Engine so first completing the `JTE: The Basics <JTE The Basics>` lab would be very helpful.

This lab will assume we're using the same pipeline configuration repository used during The Basics lab and that it is already configured as a Library Source in the Global Governance Tier.

=== Remove the Global Governance Tier's Pipeline Configuration

For the purposes of this lab, we will only be using the Pipeline Job type. In JTE: The Basics, we created added a Pipeline Configuration to the Global Governance Tier that applies to every job on the Jenkins instance.

If this is still configured, remove it.

. From the Jenkins homepage, Click `Manage Jenkins` in the lefthand navigation menu
. Click `Configure System`
. Scroll down to the `Jenkins Templating Engine` configuration section
. Under `Pipeline Configuration` dropdown menu, select `None`
. Remove any text in the `Configuration Base Directory` text box
. Click `Save`

[NOTE]
====
There should still be a global Library Source configured. Leave that there.
