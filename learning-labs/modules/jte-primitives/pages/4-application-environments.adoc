= Application Environments

== What is an Application Environment?

Performing an automated deployment is a ubiquitious step in continuous delivery pipelines.

Libraries can implement steps to perform deployments and, when doing so, need a mechanism to tell the deployment step which application environment is being deployed to.

The Application Environment acts to encapsulate the contextual information that identifies and differentiates an applications different application environments.

In general, library steps should not accept input parameters. Deployment steps are one of the few exceptions to this rule.

=== A Word on Input Parameters to Library Steps

Understanding _why_, in general, library steps should not accept input parameters is fundamental to understanding the goals of the Jenkins Templating Engine.

Let's say we had some teams in an organization leveraging SonarQube for static code analysis and others using Fortify. If the `static_code_analysis` step implemented by the `sonarqube` library took input parameters - it would then require that *every* library that implements `static_code_analysis` take input parameters lest you break the interchangeability of libraries to use the same template.

This would mean that the `fortify`'s implementation would have to take the *same* input parameters as the `sonarqube`'s implementation - otherwise switching between the two would break.

Being able to swap implementations of steps in an out through different libraries is the primary mechanism through which JTE supports creating reusable, tool-agnostic pipeline templates.

It's understandable that library steps require some externalized configuration as to not hard-code dependencies like server locations, thresholds for failure, etc. This is why library configuration is done through the pipeline configuration file and passed directly to the steps through an autowired variable as opposed to directly via input parameters.

[NOTE]
====
You can read more about how to externalize library configuration xref:1.7.1:jte:library-development:externalizing_config.adoc[here].
====

Deployment steps are different. It is safe to assume that every step that performs a deployment needs to know some environment context.

== Define and Use an Application Environment

=== Create a Deployment Library

Let's actually create a mock deployment library to demonstrate the utility of Application Environments.

In the same repository used during JTE: The Basics, add a new library called `ansible` with a step called `deploy_to` that takes an Application Environment parameter

[NOTE]
====
Remember that libraries are just subdirectories within a source code repository and that steps are just groovy files in those subdirectories that typically implement a `call` method.
====

For the sake of our pretend `ansible` library, let's assume that it needs to know a list of IP addresses relevant to the environment it's deploying to.

.libraries/ansible/deploy_to.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
void call(app_env){
    stage("Deploy To: ${app_env.long_name}"){
        println "performing a deployment through ansible.."
        app_env.ip_addresses.each{ ip ->
            println "deploying to ${ip}"
        }
    }
}
----

This step will announce it's performing an ansible deployment and then iterate over the IP addresses provided on the application environment and print out the target server.

[NOTE]
====
The file structure within your `libraries` directory should now be:

[source,]
----
.
└── libraries
    ├── ansible
    │   └── steps
    │       └── deploy_to.groovy
    ├── gradle
    │   └── steps
    │       └── build.groovy
    ├── maven
    │   └── steps
    │       └── build.groovy
    └── sonarqube
        └── steps
            └── static_code_analysis.groovy
----

====

=== Define the Application Environments in the Pipeline Configuration

We now need to load the `ansible` library and define the Application Environments.

Update the *Pipeline Configuration* to:

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
    maven
    sonarqube
    ansible
}

stages{
    continuous_integration{
        build
        static_code_analysis
    }
}

application_environments{
    dev{
        ip_addresses = [ "0.0.0.1", "0.0.0.2" ]
    }
    prod{
        long_name = "Production" 
        ip_addresses = [ "0.0.1.1", "0.0.1.2", "0.0.1.3", "0.0.1.4" ]
    }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Application Environments are defined in the `application_environments` block within the pipeline pipeline configuration.

Each key defined in this block will represent an Application Environment and a variable will be made available in the pipeline template based upon this name.

The only two keys that Application Environments explicitly define are `short_name` and `long_name`. These values default to the key defining the Application Environment in the Pipeline Configuration, but can be overridden.
====

=== Update the Pipeline Template

Now that we have a library that performs a deployment step and Application Environments defined in the Pipeline Configuration, let's update the Pipeline Template to pull it all together.

Update the *Pipeline Template* to:

[source,groovy]
----
continuous_integration() 
deploy_to dev 
deploy_to prod 
----

[NOTE]
====
These variables `dev` and `prod` come directly from the Applications Environments we just defined in the Pipeline Configuration.
====

=== Run the Pipeline

From the Pipeline job's main page, click `Build Now` in the lefthand navigation menu.

When viewing the build logs, you should see output similar to:

[source,text]
----
[Pipeline] node
Running on Jenkins in /var/jenkins_home/workspace/single-job
[Pipeline] {

[Pipeline] echo

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[JTE] [Step - ansible/deploy_to.call(ApplicationEnvironment)]
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Deploy To: Production)
[Pipeline] echo

[Pipeline] echo

[Pipeline] echo
deploying to 0.0.1.2
[Pipeline] echo
deploying to 0.0.1.3
[Pipeline] echo
deploying to 0.0.1.4
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
Finished: SUCCESS
----

Notice the output was different for the deployment to the `dev` environment vs the deployment to `prod`. This is because different values were stored in each Application Environment and the library was able to use this contextual information and respond accordingly.
