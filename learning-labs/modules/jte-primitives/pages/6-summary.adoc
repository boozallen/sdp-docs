[[JTE Primitives Summary]]
== Summary

We learned a lot in this lab! Let's recap some of what we learned:

=== Pipeline Primitives

|===
|Primitive Type |Description |Block Identifier
|Stage |Groups steps together into a single invokable method as to avoid
duplication in the Pipeline Template |`stages{}`

|Application Environment |Encapsulates environment specific context,
primarily for use in deployment steps |`application_environments{}`

|Keywords |Externalize the act of setting variables out of Pipeline
Templates and into the Pipeline Configuration |`keywords{}`

=== Why shouldn't library steps take input parameters?

It fundamentally breaks the interchangeability of different
implementations of the same step by different libraries by introducing a
requirement that all implementations of that step accept the same
parameters.
