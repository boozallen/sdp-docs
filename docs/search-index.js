feel very strongly that a project is only as valuable as it is consumable. This makes our documentation as important, if not moreso, as the code that it describes. The documentation is never done though. It can always be better, and there can also be more examples to help those new to the project get acclimated. Creating excellent documentation is a group effort. The easiest way to get started helping the Solutions Delivery Platform is to contribute to the documentation. No contribution is too small! Fix that typo. Rephase something that could be said more clearly. Whatever type of contribution you’re trying to make, this page will help explain how the documentation is organized and how to get started making changes and viewing them locally so that you can submit that Pull Request to improve the docs. Thank you for your help! Ensure the following tools are installed: Tool Description Make Used to organize and execute tasks NPM & Node Node.js and node package manager used for previewing and building the documentation git source code management Within each component’s source code repository, there is a Makefile that allows you to build the documentation and run a live-reloading preview server for local development purposes. Command Description make help outputs the available make targets make docs builds the documentation based upon the Antora playbook antora-playbook.yml make preview runs a live-reloading preview server containing the documentation stored in the component’s source code repository. The Solutions Delivery Platform leverages Antora for compiling the documentation across several source code repositories into static HTML to be deployed via GitHub Pages. Documentation should live alongside the code it describes. The documentation for the Solutions Delivery Platform is spread across the component repositories. Component Description SDP Documentation The SDP Documentation repository serves to hold documentation not specfic any component (like the Learning Labs). It also serves as the Antora playbook repository, containing the instructions to build the aggregated documentation site. Jenkins Templating Engine The Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE) is the core of the Solutions Delivery Platform. It extends Jenkins to create tool-agnostic, pipeline templates that can be reused by multiple teams. Pipeline Libraries The SDP Pipeline Libraries are the open source portfolio of pre-existing tool integration libraries that plug into the Jenkins Templating Engine to accelerage DevSecOps. Infrastructure as Code The SDP Infrastructure as Code repository holds the Infrastructure as Code and deployment guides for various reference architectures used to deploy the tools comprising a DevOps platform. With Antora, the styling of the documentation site is developed separately from the content of the site itself. Antora leverages a UI Bundle to style the documentation site. We have customized the Default Antora UI to create our own theme for Antora. This bundle can be found in the SDP Documentation Skin Repository. When viewing the documentation on your laptop, each page of the documentation has a Table of Contents with the caption On this page that you can see on the right-hand side of the article. Next to this caption, you’ll see a link to edit on GitHub. This link will send you to the current page’s source in GitHub where you can directly make edits. For smaller changes, like fixing a typo or rephrasing something, making the change directly in GitHub is sufficient. For larger changes, it’s best to clone the component repository whose documentation you’re trying to update and then leverage make preview to see your changes against a local version of the documentation while developing them. In either case, to make a change GitHub will require you to fork the repository. Commit your change to a branch on your forked repository and when happy with it, open a Pull Request and fill out the fields that have been prepopulated for you. arrow_back Welcome","title":"Contribute to this Documentation!","component":"overview","version":"1","name":"contribute-to-docs","url":"/sdp-docs/overview/1/contribute-to-docs.html","titles":[{"text":"Development Environment","id":"_development_environment"},{"text":"Make Commands","id":"_make_commands"},{"text":"Antora","id":"_antora"},{"text":"Distributed Documentation","id":"_distributed_documentation"},{"text":"The UI Bundle","id":"_the_ui_bundle"},{"text":"Making a Change","id":"_making_a_change"}]},"/sdp-docs/overview/1/index.html":{"text":"The Solutions Delivery Platform (SDP) is an accumulation of Booz Allen’s lessons learned implementing DevSecOps practices across multiple client projects and RFP Tech Challenges. At Booz Allen, DevSecOps is a foundational element of our Modern Software development Approach Over the past two years, we’ve developed an open source and reusable pipeline framework that jump starts projects. SDP has allowed the typical time to develop a pipeline from 3 to 4 months down to just a week. Instead of creating per-application pipelines, SDP allows you to create tool-agnostic, templated workflows that can be used by multiple teams to achieve organizational governance. The container orchestration platform, typically a kubernetes based solution, is responsible for hosting the DevOps tools; such as Jenkins or SonarQube. There is no strict dependency on OpenShift or Kubernetes, though this will enable a more robust platform. The Jenkins Templating Engine is a custom plugin written by Booz Allen that enables the capabilities of the Solutions Delivery Platform; such as organizational governance through templating and hierarchical configuration files. This plugin is available in the Jenkins Update Center under the name Templating Engine Plugin. The SDP Pipeline Libraries are our reusable tool integrations that contain the actual technical implementations of pipeline actions; such as static code analysis, penetration testing, and deployments. Your DevSeCops pipeline is able to observe everything about software delivery for your project or organization. Through SDP, you would be able to aggregate these metrics into a DevSecOps dashboard to enable continuous improvement of your processes.

The default step implementation allows you to define a step from the Pipeline Configuration that specifies a container image as the runtime environment for the step, a shell command or script to execute, and then a stash to be created in order to store files generated. The default step implementation allows a quick and dirty way to quickly prototype a step on the fly without needing to create a library. Using container images for pipeline runtime dependencies is an excellent way to build a DevSecOps pipeline that is loosely coupled to the underlying infrastructure. The default step implementation can be a little too powerful if you’re striving for a tightly governed DevSecOps pipeline. This feature should be exposed to end users with care. This feature hard codes a particular functionality from the Pipeline Configuration and does not have the same configuration flexibility that a library would have. In the same Pipeline Job we were using during the JTE: Pipeline Primitives lab, let’s add a new step called unit_test(). Append to the Pipeline Configuration: steps{ unit_test{ stage = \"Unit Test\" image = \"maven\" command = \"mvn -v\" } } Steps implemented through the default step implementation are defined in the steps block of the Pipeline Configuration. Root level keys within the steps block become the name of the step that can be invoked from the Pipeline Template. The step above creates a unit_test step that can be invoked from the Pipeline Template that executes the command mvn -v inside the maven:latest container image from Docker Hub.

For example, let’s say we wanted to introduce Splunk monitoring by sending events as part of the pipeline. How do you: Maintain a clean, easy to read Pipeline Template? Maintain a separation of duties between libraries as to not hardcode a Splunk integration into every library step? It would be great if there was a seemless way to inject functionality in response to different phases of the pipeline without having to tightly couple that functionality to existing library steps or Pipeline Templates. You can! The Jenkins Templating Engine has a neat feature we call Pipeline Lifecycle Hooks that were made for just these situations. We’ll walk through the Splunk use case to demonstrate this functionality. Read the entire pipeline lifecycle hook documentation. Methods defined within steps are able to register themselves to correspond to specific lifecycle events via annotations. As such, thesesteps are typically not invoked directly by other steps or from the Pipeline Template. Because of this, the name of the step is inconsequential but cannot conflict with other step names that are loaded. Therefore, we typically recommend following a naming convention of prepending the step name with the library name to namespace the hooks. It doesn’t matter what you call steps that only contain Pipeline Lifecycle Hook annotated methods. But to avoid collisions of everyone naming their hook steps beforeStep.groovy - we recommend _ as we’ll demonstrate in this lab. Within the same Library Source created during JTE: The Basics create a step called splunk_pipeline_start.groovy: libraries/splunk/splunk_pipeline_start.groovy @Init void call(context){ println \"Splunk: beginning of the pipeline!\" } Breaking down this step, the @Init registers the call method defined in this step to be invoked at the beginning of the pipeline. This call method takes a Map as an input parameter. This argument represents the pipeline context and will let you know the pipeline’s current status as well as the library and step that the hook is responding to. This input parameter to annotated steps is typically called context but can be called anything. Since Groovy is a dynamically typed language, this input parameter does not have to be given a class. In the Pipeline job again, update the Pipeline Configuration to load the splunk library we just created. libraries{ maven sonarqube ansible splunk } That’s it! Just by loading the library, JTE will be able to find the methods within steps annotated with a Pipeline Lifecycle Hook. Run the Pipeline job and you should see output in the logs similar to: [JTE] [@Init - splunk/splunk_pipeline_start.call] [Pipeline] echo Splunk: beginning of the pipeline! Let’s add some hooks that inject themselves both before and after each step is executed in the pipeline. libraries/splunk/splunk_step_watcher.groovy: @BeforeStep void before(context){ println \"Splunk: running before the ${context.library} library's ${context.step} step\" } @AfterStep void after(context){ println \"Splunk: running after the ${context.library} library's ${context.step} step\" } Here, we’re defining two different methods in a single step. In the next section we’ll talk about this in more detail. For right now, the important piece is that the method’s have the @BeforeStep and @AfterStep annotations.

[Pipeline] End of Pipeline What if we only wanted to execute the @AfterStep hook to be executed after the static_code_analysis step? Pipeline Lifecycle Hook annotations accept a Closure parameter. This Closure will be executed, and if the return of the Closure is non-false the step will be executed. Remember: Groovy has implicit return statements. The last statement made becomes the return object by default. We call this functionality Conditional Hook Execution. Let’s see it in action. Update the @AfterStep created in libraries/splunk/splunk_step_watcher.groovy to: @AfterStep({ context.step.equals(\"static_code_analysis\") }) Rerun the pipeline and notice that now, the hook has been restricted to only run after the desired step. When the Closure parameter is invoked, it will have access to the context variable that is passed to the step itself as well as the library configuration that is stored via the config variable. It would be even better if we could externalize the configuration of exactly which steps the @AfterStep hook should be triggered. To do this, update the @AfterStep annotation again to be: @AfterStep({ context.step in config.afterSteps }) Now, we can conditionally execute the hook by checking if the name of the step that was just executed is in an array called afterSteps defined as part of the splunk library in the Pipeline Configuration! Update the splunk portion of the Pipeline Configuration to: libraries{ maven sonarqube ansible splunk{ afterSteps = [ \"static_code_analysis\", \"unit_test\" ] } } Run the pipeline again and notice that the hook was only executed after the steps defined in the Pipeline Configuration. Conditional Execution Closure Parameters can be passed to any Pipeline Lifecycle Hook annotation. As long as the Closure returns a non-false value, the hook will be invoked. Remember to read through the Pipeline Lifecycle Hook documentation to see all the annotations available. arrow_back Default Step Implementation Multi-Method Steps arrow_forward","title":"Pipeline Lifecycle Hooks","component":"learning-labs","version":"1","name":"3-pipeline-lifecycle-hooks","url":"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-advanced-features/3-pipeline-lifecycle-hooks.html","titles":[{"text":"Create a Splunk Library","id":"_create_a_splunk_library"},{"text":"Notify of Pipeline Start","id":"_notify_of_pipeline_start"},{"text":"Update the Pipeline Configuration","id":"_update_the_pipeline_configuration"},{"text":"Add Before and After Step Execution Hooks","id":"_add_before_and_after_step_execution_hooks"},{"text":"Notify of End of Pipeline Execution","id":"_notify_of_end_of_pipeline_execution"},{"text":"Restricting Hook Execution","id":"_restricting_hook_execution"},{"text":"Update the @AfterStep Annotation","id":"_update_the_afterstep_annotation"},{"text":"Taking It A Step Further","id":"_taking_it_a_step_further"}]},"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-advanced-features/4-multimethod-steps.html":{"text":"While learning about Pipeline Lifecycle Hooks, we created a step that: implemented multiple methods did not implement a call method In this section, we’re going to dive into multi-method steps in a little more detail. Have you ever wondered why library steps create a method named call? This is because, in groovy, something() gets translated to something.call(). If we understand this concept, then it would make sense that we could define other methods within our steps and invoke them by their full name. The most common use case for defining multiple methods inside one step file is when you’re creating some utility functionality. To demonstrate this, let’s create a mock git utility that can add, commit, and push. In the same Pipeline Configuration Repository we used for JTE: The Basics, create a git library. Because we’re creating a git utility, add a file called git.groovy with the contents: /* takes an arraylist of files to pass to git add */ void add(ArrayList files){ println \"git add ${files.join(\" \")}\" } /* takes a string commit message to pass to git commit */ void commit(String message){ println \"git commit -m ${message}\" } /* performs the git push */ void push(){ println \"git push\" } In this example, we’re creating a step that serves as a utility wrapper. These are typically not invoked directly by Pipeline Templates but rather consumed by other steps. That is why it is okay, in this case, to accept input parameters for these methods. We will be invoking this functionality directly from the Pipeline Template to demonstrate its functionality. The filestructure for your Pipeline Configuration libraries directory should now be: . ├── libraries ├── ansible │ └── deploy_to.groovy ├── git │ └── git.groovy ├── gradle │ └── build.groovy ├── maven │ └── build.groovy ├── sonarqube │ └── static_code_analysis.groovy └── splunk ├── splunk_pipeline_end.groovy ├── splunk_pipeline_start.groovy └── splunk_step_watcher.groovy Update the Pipeline Configuration to load the git library. The libraries portion of the Pipeline Configuration should now be: libraries{ maven sonarqube ansible splunk{ afterSteps = [ \"static_code_analysis\", \"unit_test\" ] } git } Prepend to the existing Pipeline Template: git.add([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]) git.commit \"my commit message\" git.push() Important When invoking a non-call method defined within a step, you do so by .().

As pipeline templates mature in complexity and grow to represent branching strategies for application development teams, it’s likely that you would want to call the same series of steps multiple times in the template. To minimize repeating ourselves in pipeline templates, the Stage primitive was created to address this use case. View the Stage documentation A very common stage to create is a Continuous Integration stage. In general, Continuous Integration represents a series of fast-feedback verification steps that help developers quickly determine if the changes made have broken anything obvious. It’s common to run steps like building an artifact, running unit tests, and performing static code analysis on every commit to feature branches in a source code repository and then once again in the Pull Request job to verify the merged result is still good. Our current pipeline template specifies to run the build() and static_code_analysis() steps. Let’s group these together into a continuous_integration() stage. Update the Pipeline Configuration to: libraries{ maven sonarqube } stages{ continuous_integration{ build static_code_analysis } } All Stages will be defined in the stages block of the Pipeline Configuration. Root level keys within this block, in this case continuous_integration, will become invokable methods within the pipeline template. The lines within the continuous_integration block outline which steps will be chained together when the stage is invoked. With the continuous_integration stage defined, we can update the pipeline template to make use of it.

Libraries can implement steps to perform deployments and, when doing so, need a mechanism to tell the deployment step which application environment is being deployed to. The Application Environment acts to encapsulate the contextual information that identifies and differentiates an applications different application environments. In general, library steps should not accept input parameters. Deployment steps are one of the few exceptions to this rule. View the Application Environment documentation Understanding why, in general, library steps should not accept input parameters is fundamental to understanding the goals of the Jenkins Templating Engine. Let’s say we had some teams in an organization leveraging SonarQube for static code analysis and others using Fortify. If the static_code_analysis step implemented by the sonarqube library took input parameters - it would then require that every library that implements static_code_analysis take input parameters lest you break the interchangeability of libraries to use the same template. This would mean that the `fortify’s implementation would have to take the same input parameters as the `sonarqube’s implementation - otherwise switching between the two would break. Being able to swap implementations of steps in an out through different libraries is the primary mechanism through which JTE supports creating reusable, tool-agnostic pipeline templates. It’s understandable that library steps require some externalized configuration as to not hard-code dependencies like server locations, thresholds for failure, etc. This is why library configuration is done through the pipeline configuration file and passed directly to the steps through an autowired variable as opposed to directly via input parameters. You can read more about how to externalize library configuration here. Deployment steps are different. It is safe to assume that every step that performs a deployment needs to know some environment context. Let’s actually create a mock deployment library to demonstrate the utility of Application Environments. In the same repository used during JTE: The Basics, add a new library called ansible with a step called deploy_to that takes an Application Environment parameter Remember that libraries are just subdirectories within a source code repository and that steps are just groovy files in those subdirectories that typically implement a call method. For the sake of our pretend ansible library, let’s assume that it needs to know a list of IP addresses relevant to the environment it’s deploying too. libraries/ansible/deploy_to.groovy void call(app_env){ stage(\"Deploy To: ${app_env.long_name}\"){ println \"performing a deployment through ansible..\" app_env.ip_addresses.each{ ip -> println \"deploying to ${ip}\" } } } This step will announce it’s performing an ansible deployment and then iterate over the IP addresses provided on the application environment and print out the target server. The file structure within your libraries directory should now be: . ├── libraries ├── ansible │ └── deploy_to.groovy ├── gradle │ └── build.groovy ├── maven │ └── build.groovy └── sonarqube └── static_code_analysis.groovy We now need to load the ansible library and define the Application Environments. Update the Pipeline Configuration to: libraries{ maven sonarqube ansible } stages{ continuous_integration{ build static_code_analysis } } application_environments{ dev{ ip_addresses = [ \"0.0.0.1\", \"0.0.0.2\" ] } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" ip_addresses = [ \"0.0.1.1\", \"0.0.1.2\", \"0.0.1.3\", \"0.0.1.4\" ] } } Application Environments are defined in the application_environments block within the pipeline pipeline configuration. Each key defined in this block will represent an Application Environment and a variable will be made available in the pipeline template based upon this name. The only two keys that Application Environments explicitly define are short_name and long_name. These values default to the key defining the Application Environment in the Pipeline Configuration, but can be overridden. Now that we have a library that performs a deployment step and Application Environments defined in the Pipeline Configuration, let’s update the Pipeline Template to pull it all together. Update the Pipeline Template to: continuous_integration() deploy_to dev deploy_to prod These variables dev and prod come directly from the Applications Environments we just defined in the Pipeline Configuration.

Retrieving libraries from a repository is the most common way of storing pipeline libraries for integration with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Go ahead and create a new GitHub repository. It can be named whatever you like, though jte-the-basics would make sense.

Since there might be other sources in this repository in the future, all of the libraries we create will be stored in the libraries directory. It is important to understand that a library in JTE is just a directory, likely in a source code repository, that contains groovy files. When a library is loaded, each groovy file in the library’s directory will become a step named after the base filename. In this lab, we’re just getting accustomed to the Jenkins Templating Engine and how it works. So the implementation of the steps for this lab will just be print statements that show where the step is coming from. Generally, the most idiomatic way to define a step is to create a call method that takes no input parameters. In future labs, we’ll learn how to pass information to our steps through the pipeline configuration file. libraries/maven/build.groovy void call(){ stage(\"Maven: Build\"){ println \"build from the maven library\" } } libraries/sonarqube/static_code_analysis.groovy void call(){ stage(\"SonarQube: Static Code Analysis\"){ println \"static code analysis from the sonarqube library\" } } Now that we have a GitHub repository containing pipeline libraries, we have to tell JTE where to find them. This is done by configuring a Library Source in Jenkins. You can define as many Library Sources as you need. They can be defined globally for the entire Jenkins instance in Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Jenkins Templating Engine or under the Jenkins Templating Engine configuration section on Folders. To make our libraries accessible to every job configured to use JTE on the Jenkins instace: In the lefthand navigation menu, click Manage Jenkins Select the first option, Configure System Scroll down to the Jenkins Templating Engine configuration section Click Add under Library Sources Ensure the Library Provider is set to From SCM Select Git as the SCM type Enter the https repository URL In the Credentials drop down menu, select the github credential created during the prerequisites Enter libraries in the Base Directory text box Click Save arrow_back Write the Template Configure the Pipeline arrow_forward","title":"Create the Libraries","component":"learning-labs","version":"1","name":"3-first-libraries","url":"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-the-basics/3-first-libraries.html","titles":[{"text":"Create a GitHub Repository","id":"_create_a_github_repository"},{"text":"Create the Libraries","id":"_create_the_libraries"},{"text":"Implement the Steps","id":"_implement_the_steps"},{"text":"Configure the Library Source","id":"_configure_the_library_source"}]},"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-the-basics/4-first-configuration-file.html":{"text":"With the libraries created now discoverable by JTE, we can configure the pipeline and run it!

Simplify pipeline maintainability Separating a pipeline into a templates, configuration file, and pipeline libraries can also be thought of as separating the business logic of your pipeline from the technical implementation. In our experience, it is significantly easier to manage a template backed by modularized pipeline libraries than it is to manage application-specific Jenkinsfiles. Organizational Governance With the traditional Jenkinsfile defined within, and duplicated across, source code repositories it can be very challenging to ensure the same process is being followed by disparate application development teams and confirm that organizational policies around code quality and security are being met. JTE brings a level of governance to your pipelines by centralizing the definition of the pipeline workflow to a common place. To demonstrate the reusability of pipeline templates, what would happen if the development team switched to using Gradle? All we would have to do is create a gradle library that implements the build() step of the pipeline template. Remember that a library is just a subdirectory within the Base Directory configured as part of the Library Source in Jenkins. So to create the gradle library we should create a gradle directory under the libraries directory. Then, to implement the build() step for the pipeline, create a build.groovy file within the newly created gradle subdirectory. When you have created the new gradle directory and build.groovy file, your repository file structure will now be: . └── libraries ├── gradle │ └── build.groovy ├── maven │ └── build.groovy └── sonarqube └── static_code_analysis.groovy The contents of the build.groovy should be: void call(){ stage(\"Gradle: Build\"){ println \"build from the gradle library\" } } If you added this library on your local computer instead of through the GitHub UI, then please make sure you’ve pushed this change to the master branch of the repository. Now that we have a swappable implementation for the build() step of the pipeline template, switching from Maven to Gradle is as easy as changing the pipeline configuration. Going back to the job configuration, in the Pipeline Configuration text box, swap the maven line to gradle and click Save. The pipeline configuration should now be: libraries{ gradle sonarqube } Follow the same steps as before to run the job again and checkout the build logs: Started by user admin Running in Durability level: MAX_SURVIVABILITY [Pipeline] Start of Pipeline [JTE] Pipeline Configuration Modifications (show) [JTE] Loading Library gradle (show) [JTE] Library gradle does not have a configuration file.

This is a more realistic scenario and it has the added benefit of taking the pipeline template and pipeline configuration file out of the Jenkins UI and storing them in a pipeline configuration repository. When creating libraries, we created a GitHub repository and stored the libraries in a subdirectory called libraries. In this example, we can create a new subdirectory at the root of the repositories called pipeline-configuration. The actual names of the libraries and pipeline-configuration subdirectories do not matter and are configurable. Within this pipeline-configuration directory create a file called Jenkinsfile and populate it with the same contents as the Pipeline Template text box in the Jenkins UI. pipeline-configuration/Jenkinsfile build() static_code_analysis() The Jenkinsfile is the default pipeline template that will be used. It is possible to define more than one pipeline template and let application teams select which template applies to them. More on that later, or read the docs. In the same pipeline-configuration directory, create a file called pipeline_config.groovy. When the pipeline configuration is stored in a file in a source code repository, it will always be called pipeline_config.groovy. Populate this file with the same contents as the Pipeline Configuration text box in the Jenkins UI. pipeline-configuration/pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ gradle sonarqube } The file structure in your GitHub repository should now look like this: . ├── libraries │ ├── gradle │ │ └── build.groovy │ ├── maven │ │ └── build.groovy │ └── sonarqube │ └── static_code_analysis.groovy └── pipeline-configuration ├── Jenkinsfile └── pipeline_config.groovy Now that we have our template and pipeline configuration externalized into a source code repository, we have to tell Jenkins where to find it. From the Jenkins home page: In the lefthand navigation menu click Manage Jenkins Click Configure System Scroll down to the Jenkins Templating Engine configuration section Select Git for the Source Location drop down menu Under Repository URL type the https URL for the GitHub Repository containing the libraries, template, and configuration file In the Credentials drop down menu, select the github credential created during the prerequisites Type pipeline-configuration in the Configuration Base Directory text box Click Save You just configured your first Governance Tier! Governance Tiers are the combination of: A pipeline configuration repository specifying where the pipeline configuration file and pipeline templates can be found A set of library sources When done in Manage Jenkins > Configure System it’s called the Global Governance Tier and applies to every job on the Jenkins instance. Governance Tiers can also be configured on every Folder in Jenkins. When configured, they apply to every Job within that Folder. Through Governance Tiers, you can create a governance hierarchy that matches your organizational hierarchy just by how you organize jobs within Jenkins. We’re going to apply the pipeline template and configuration file to every branch in a GitHub repository. Create a GitHub Repository that will serve as our mock application repository named jte-the-basics-app-gradle Initialize the Repository with a README Modify the README in order to create a branch called test Now that we have a GitHub repository representing our application, we can create a Multibranch Project in Jenkins. Multibranch Projects are Folders in Jenkins that automatically create pipeline jobs for every branch and Pull Request in the source code repository they represent. Through JTE, we can configure each branch and Pull Request to use the same pipeline template. This removes the Jenkinsfile from the repository. From the Jenkins home page, select New Item in the lefthand navigation menu In the Enter an item name text box, type gradle-app Select Multibranch Pipeline as the job type Click OK Under Branch Sources > Add Source select GitHub Select the github credential under the Credentials drop down menu Enter the https repository URL under Repository HTTPS URL Under the Build Configuration select Jenkins Templating Engine from the mode drop down menu Click Save When the job is created, you will be redirected to a page showing the logs for scanning the repository.

Let’s walk through how you would setup JTE to this situation where one application is using maven, the other application is using gradle, and both applications are using SonarQube. We already have a pipeline configuration repository that has our pipeline template, pipeline configuration file, and pipeline libraries as well as a repository that represents an application using gradle. Follow the same procedure as before when creating the gradle application’s repository to create a maven application repository named jte-the-basics-app-maven. Now that there are multiple applications with some configurations that are common and some configurations that are unique, we need to introduce the concept of pipeline configuration aggregation. We need to edit the pipeline configuration file (pipeline_config.groovy) we created earlier to represent the common configurations that will be applied to both apps and explicitly allow these applications to add their own configurations. pipeline-configuration/pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ merge = true sonarqube } In this configuration, both applications are using SonarQube. Since this is a common configuration, we’ll leave it in the Governance Tier’s configuration file. The application repositories will each get their own pipeline_config.groovy to indicate if they are using the maven or the gradle library. Since we want to allow these apps to add additional configurations, we need to be explicit about that by setting merge = true in the libraries block of the pipeline configuration. When aggregating pipeline configurations, JTE applies conditional inheritance during the aggregation process. To learn more on conditional inheritance, read the docs. In the jte-the-basics-app-maven repository we just created, add a pipeline_config.groovy file at the root that specifies you want to load the maven library. pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ maven } Since this application will inherit the global configurations defined in the Governance Tier, we don’t have to duplicate the configuration of loading the sonarqube library in the repo level pipeline configuration. In the jte-the-basics-app-gradle repository we created earlier for the Multibranch Project, add a pipeline_config.groovy file at the root that specifies you want to load the gradle library. pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ gradle } We created a Multibranch Project that automatically created jobs for every branch and Pull Request in a repository. Now, we’ll create a GitHub Organization Project that can automatically create Multibranch Projects for every repository within a GitHub Organization. From the Jenkins home page, select New Item in the lefthand navigation menu Select a name for the job. Select GitHub Organization the click OK at the bottom of the screen Select the GitHub credential under the Credentials drop down menu Enter your GitHub username under the Owner field Under Behaviors click Add then under Repositories (not to be confused with Within Repositories), select Filter by name (with wildcards) Enter jte-the-basics-app-* in the Include text box (assuming you’ve following the naming recommendations of the application repositories) Under Project Recognizers hit the red X to delete the Pipeline Jenkinsfile Recognizers Under Project Recognizers select Add and click Jenkins Templating Engine Click Save After creating the GitHub Organization job in Jenkins, you will be redirected to the logs of the GitHub Organization being scanned to find repositories that match the wildcard format entered during job creation. This will scope the repositories for which jobs are created to just this lab’s application repositories. Once scanning has finished, go view the GitHub Orgnization’s job page in Jenkins and you will see two Multibranch Projects have been created for example-jte-app-gradle and example-jte-app-maven. Explore each of these jobs to see that the gradle repository’s pipeline loaded the gradle library and the maven repository loaded the maven library and both pipelines loaded the sonarqube library. We just created a configuration where multiple applications used the same pipeline template, shared a common configuration, but still have the flexibility to choose the correct build tool for their application. arrow_back Apply to a GitHub Repository Summary arrow_forward","title":"Apply to Multiple GitHub Repositories","component":"learning-labs","version":"1","name":"7-github-org","url":"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-the-basics/7-github-org.html","titles":[{"text":"Create a New GitHub Repository","id":"_create_a_new_github_repository"},{"text":"Modify the Pipeline Configurations","id":"_modify_the_pipeline_configurations"},{"text":"Modify the Governance Tier Configuration File","id":"_modify_the_governance_tier_configuration_file"},{"text":"Create a Pipeline Configuration File for the Maven Application","id":"_create_a_pipeline_configuration_file_for_the_maven_application"},{"text":"Create a Pipeline Configuration File for the Gradle Application","id":"_create_a_pipeline_configuration_file_for_the_gradle_application"},{"text":"Create a GitHub Organization Project","id":"_create_a_github_organization_project"}]},"/sdp-docs/learning-labs/1/jte-the-basics/8-summary.html":{"text":"We learned a lot in this lab!

Pipelines are typically defined on a per application basis via a Jenkinsfile in the source code repository. Often, common code can be pulled out into Shared Libraries to reduce code duplication but a few problems remain. Organization’s application portfolios often have a diverse technology stack, each requiring their own pipeline-as-code integrations. It becomes increasingly complex to manage these different implementations across an organization while standardizing on the required software delivery processes. For organizations with strict governance requirements having a Jenkinsfile within the source code repository can allow developers to bypass these mandatory requirements. The real power of JTE comes from creating shareable workflows and using them across teams. JTE allows you to create a centralized hierarchical governance for your pipeline configurations that aligns to your organizational structure. With governance tiers, organizations can accelerate enterprise adoption by creating inheritable pipelines that share common configurations. JTE allows you to share pipeline code effectively across multiple teams through the use of common pipeline libraries. When supporting pipelines for multiple applications it becomes more challenging to maintain the associated complexity. Multiple tech stacks and tool integrations can lead to largely similar Jenkinsfiles with distinct differences around how specific parts of the pipeline function. JTE embraces the traditional software development practices of modularity and separation of concerns to create a more organized code base for your pipelines. At Booz Allen, we created the Jenkins Templating Engine to support our Solutions Delivery Platform; a DevSecOps platform accelerating adoption of modern software development best practices.

The goal is to make it easier to help contributors find the root cause of bugs or extension points from which to add additional functionality. These docs are going to be added to as time allows. JTE has a couple different areas of functionality: Parsing Pipeline Configuration Files Aggregating Pipeline Configuration Files Initializing the Binding The different Pipeline Primitives JTE exposes Parsing files and compiling them into Scripts to execute Fetching files from SCM Each of these areas of functionality are decoupled, so improving JTE’s functionality should involve a relatively limited blast radius of changes. Writing pipeline templates and implementing pipeline libraries should remain as syntactically close to writing typical Jenkins pipeline-as-code as possible. The Jenkins Templating Engine simply provides a different way to organize your code to optimize the modularity in order to create tool-agnostic, pipeline templates. Any JTE specific features, such as the config variable exposed to libraries, should be kept as minimal as possible and only exist to facilitate ease of pipeline development within the framework. The Jenkins Templating Engine is first and foremost a pipeline templating framework. It turns out that one of the values in templating is the ability to enforce organizational standards through common configurations and reuse. topic description Initialization Process The Initialization Process describes what happens when a new pipeline run starts to prepare the runtime environment to execute the template. arrow_back Library Selection Initialization Process arrow_forward","title":"Developer Documentation","component":"jte","version":"1.6","name":"index","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/developer/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Design Principles","id":"_design_principles"},{"text":"Decoupled Implementations","id":"_decoupled_implementations"},{"text":"Lighweight","id":"_lighweight"},{"text":"Governance is a Dial","id":"_governance_is_a_dial"},{"text":"Specific Topics","id":"_specific_topics"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/developer/initialization.html":{"text":"Understanding the Initialization Process is the key to understanding the Jenkins Templating Engine. So what exactly do I mean by \"Initialization Process\"? The Initialization Process is what happens between a pipeline run beginning and the user-defined pipeline template being executed. The TemplateEntryPointVariable is where it all starts, specifically the getValue() method. The first thing JTE does is gather all of the Pipeline Configuration Files and merge them together to produce an aggregated pipeline configuration file. That process is as follows. The PipelineConfig class is responsible for storing the aggregated pipeline configuration (represented as a TemplateConfigObject). It also contains the business logic related to merging multiple pipeline configurations. Upon creation, the default pipeline configuration is read from the resources directory. In JTE, a Governance Tier stores a hierarchical pipeline configuration and a list of Library Sources that pipelines under this tier inherit. The Global Governance Tier is configured under Manage Jenkins > Configure System. Subsequent tiers are defined on folders. Therefore, you create governance hierarchies in JTE by creating folder hierarchies and when appropriate, configuring the folder’s Governance Tier with a pipeline configuration file. JTE will aggregate all the pipeline job’s parent pipeline configuration files to produce an aggregated pipeline configuration that will subsequently be used to configure the pipeline for this run. JTE fetches the configured Governance Tiers in order via the static GovernanceTier.getHierarchy(). For each tier, we call tier.getConfig() which returns the parsed result of a pipeline configuration file, a TemplateConfigObject. We then pass this TemplateConfigObject to the PipelineConfig’s join method, which merges the current pipeline configuration with the incoming pipeline configuration and logs the modifications using the TemplateLogger TemplateConfigDSL.parse(String file) is used to translate JTE’s custom configuration DSL into a TemplateConfigObject. The trick to the Jenkins Templating Engine is that pipeline templates get executed just like Jenkinsfiles. It’s just that this initialization process prepares the script environment by populating some variables (called Primitives in JTE) in the script binding before executing the template. In groovy, the script binding is where undeclared variables are stored. It can be thought of as a global key-value store. def x = 1 // variable is declared, and therefore not stored in the binding y = 2 // variable is not declared and stored in the binding y = 2 is the same as saying getBinding().setVariable(\"y\", 2) JTE works because the Jenkins pipelines will execute variables stored in the binding that respond to the call method, a feature introduced here. JTE uses a custom script binding implementation, the TemplateBinding, to prevent loaded Primitives from being overwritten during intialization or accidentally by library developers. Everything JTE populates the binding with (various Primitives and steps loaded from libraries) are extensions of the TemplatePrimitive class. Extending the TemplatePrimitive class is what marks the object as \"protected\" in the TemplateBinding, preventing it from being overridden inadvertently. Each primitive has an associated TemplatePrimitiveInjector that takes the aggregated pipeline configuration, parses it, and creates instances of the primitive to inject it into the binding. At this point, the pipeline’s runtime environment has been appropriately hydrated based upon the aggregated pipeline configuration. We can now execute the TemplateEntryPoint, which optionally checks out the branch source associated with the pipeline, determines the pipeline template, and executes it. arrow_back Developer Documentation","title":"Initialization Process","component":"jte","version":"1.6","name":"initialization","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/developer/initialization.html","titles":[{"text":"Start at the Beginning: TemplateEntryPointVariable","id":"_start_at_the_beginning_templateentrypointvariable"},{"text":"Aggregate the Pipeline Configuration Files","id":"_aggregate_the_pipeline_configuration_files"},{"text":"Create a New PipelineConfig Object","id":"_create_a_new_pipelineconfig_object"},{"text":"Aggregate the Pipeline Configurations","id":"_aggregate_the_pipeline_configurations"},{"text":"Prepare the Binding","id":"_prepare_the_binding"},{"text":"Custom Binding Implementation","id":"_custom_binding_implementation"},{"text":"Calling All Injectors","id":"_calling_all_injectors"},{"text":"Execute the Template","id":"_execute_the_template"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/governance/conditional_inheritance.html":{"text":"The JTE configuration file DSL allows you to build arbitrary nested key-value pair structures. The merging of two configuration files assumes that by default, if a key has already been set it may not be overridden unless explictly allowed via the merge and override flags. We will walk through an example of what happens when neither of these flags have been set for a configuration block, as well as the result of adding one of the flags to a block. Let’s say that a Governance Tier has defined the application environments to be used by all applications within it’s purview: Governance Tier Configuration File application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Now let’s assume an application’s configuration file attempts to add their own application environment to the configuration: application_environments{ impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } In this example, the application’s configuration will be ignored because it’s parent configuration has not allowed modifications to the application_environments key Now let’s say the Governance Tier wanted to allow this sort of customization. By setting merge = true within the application_environments block, the Governance Tier is saying that new keys may be added to the block. In this case - this means allowing subconfigurations to append their own application environments. Governance Tier Configuration: application_environments{ merge = true dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Application Configuration File: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } The application configuration has tried to add a new configuration to the dev application environment as well as add their own impl environment. Resultant Configuration: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } By setting merge = true the Governance Tier has allowed new keys to be added to the application_environments block. This meant that the impl application environment was added as a new key but the modification to the dev environment was ignored. To allow this as well, the Governance Tier would specify merge = true within the dev block. If the Governance Tier in this example was setting application environments as reasonable defaults but was not interested in enforcing the use of these environments, they could allow application configurations to take precedence by setting override = true in the application_environments block. Governance Tier Configuration: application_environments{ override = true dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Application Configuration File: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } Resultant Configuration: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } You’ll notice that the resultant configuration equals that of the application’s configuration.

After the first configuration file, each subsequent file will only be able to add new root configuration keys and any configuration that overlaps with the existing configuration will be ignored unless the parent configuration has explicitly allowed a configuration block to be modified via the merge and override keys. Setting merge = true in a configuration block will allow the next configuration file in the hierarchy to append configuration keys to the block. Setting override = true in a configuration block will allow the next configuration file to replace the existing configuration block. You can see some examples of these keywords in action here.

This step is typically called indirectly when using a MultiBranch Project or when creating a GitHub Organization Job. When this step is executed, the pipeline will have access to the primitives that have been defined via the aggregated result of the specified pipeline configuration files as well as any steps that have been contributed by loaded libraries. The real power in the Jenkins Templating Engine is that it allows you to externalize the Jenkinsfile from an individual source code repository, and generalize it to be used by multiple teams simultaneously. This means that the default way to define a Template is externally in a source code repository via a Governance Tier. This is exactly what happens when you invoke the template step directly with no parameters via template(). When no parameters are passed, the pipeline configuration files defined on each Governance Tier are aggregated. This aggregated configuration is then used to initialize the Template’s environment with the various Primitives that were defined as well as load any libraries that have been configured. The template step itself takes an optional Closure parameter. This Closure parameter is most often used for testing, though if governance is not a factor it works just as well as defining your pipeline template externally. Let’s assume that you are running a typical Jenkinsfile and want to invoke the template step directly. You have configured a Governance Tier that will load a library contributing a build() step. Executing this build step then, can be done by trying to invoke it from within the context of the template step as follows: /* here you do not have access to the build step because it has not been loaded yet */ template{ /* now that you are within the context of the template step, the library will have been loaded and you will be able to execute the build step */ build() } When a Closure is passed to the template step - we do not look for a template, regardless if a Governance Tier specifies what template should be used.

In order to achieve this level of reusability, it’s best to externalize hard coded values as parameters that can be set from the pipeline configuration repository.

README.rst example/ printAThing.groovy With this source code repository configured as a Library Source, we would be able to load the example library from our pipeline configuration repository and invoke the printAThing() step from a pipeline template. When writing a library step, a config variable comes autowired into your scope that can be referenced to access configurations defined in your library block from the configuration file. Let’s create a configuration parameter number to represent the number of times to print the message and a configuration parameter message to represent the message to be printed. pipeline_config.groovy: libraries{ example{ number = 3 message = \"my message to be printed!\" } } We can now write our library step to access these parameters directly on the config variable automatically provided to the step. To access the number of times to print the message, read the config.number value. To access the message to be printed, read the config.message value. printAThing.groovy: void call(){ for(def i = 0, i < config.number, i++){ println config.message } } We learned how to access external library configurations via the pipeline configuration repository. These parameters can be any serializable data type and are accessible from within your step via the autowired config variable. The pipeline step we built today has some flaws.

Libraries are configured as Library Sources either globally as part of the Global Jenkins Templating Engine configuration or within a particular Governance Tier. Once a SCM repository has been set as a Library Source, you can begin creating libraries. Creating a Library is as easy as creating a root level directory within your configured Library Source’s source code repository. An example repository structure could be: README.rst example_library/ The library is named and is referenceable by the directory name. To create a step, create a .groovy file within the library directory. The step name will be that of the basename of the file. For example, to create a build step, add a build.groovy file: README.rst example_library/ build.groovy In most cases, writing a step is done by defining a call method within the groovy step file created. This call method can take input arguments and return objects. Within the step you can execute any old regular Jenkins pipeline code, including invoking other steps defined by loaded libraries. Let’s say you wanted this build step to run mvn clean verify, your build.groovy file could be: void call(){ node{ sh \"mvn clean verify\" } } Steps, like regular global variables in Jenkins Shared Libraries, can define methods other than call. See an example here. With a directory created called example_library within your Library Source, you can now load this library from your pipeline configuration to make the steps contained therein accessible from your pipeline template. pipeline_config.groovy: libraries{ example_library } With the example_library library loaded via your pipeline configuration file, you can then invoke the build step from a pipeline template via: build() which will execute the shell command defined in the step.

For example, if you wanted to send multiple notification types after a particular pipeline step or at the conclusion of a pipeline if the build was failure. JTE supports this type of Aspect Oriented Programming style event handling through annotation markers that can be placed on library steps. The following lifecycle hook annotations are available: Table 1. JTE LifeCycle Hook annotations Annotation Description @Validate Will get executed at the beginning of a pipeline run, should throw exception if this step does not have its prerequesites @Init Will get executed at the beginning of a pipeline run, after Validate @BeforeStep Will get executed before every pipeline step invocation @AfterStep Will get executed after every pipeline step invocation @CleanUp Will get executed at the end of a pipeline run @Notify Will get executed after every pipeline step invocation as well as at the end of the pipeline run In order to write a pipeline step leveraging one of these lifecycle hooks, you must annotate the step with the annotation and accept a context input parameter to the method. This context parameter provides context so that the step can vary its behavior based on what just happened in the pipeline. Table 2. JTE LifeCycle Hook Context Parameter Variable Description context.library The name of the Library that contributed the step associated with the hook context.step The name of the Step associated with the hook context.status The current pipeline build status context.library and context.step will be null before and after pipeline execution and are only to be leveraged by @BeforeStep, @AfterStep, and @Notify The reference to the variable name context makes the assumption that you’ve named the input parameter to the step with the hook annotation context. In practice, this variable name can be whatever you please Sometimes you’ll only want to invoke the Hook when certain conditions are met, such as a build failure or in relation to another step (like before static code analysis). Each annotation accepts a Closure parameter. If the return object of this closure is true http://www.groovy-lang.org/semantics.html#Groovy-Truth then the hook will be executed. While executing, the code within the Closure will be able to resolve the context variable described above as well as the library configuration variable config. Example Syntax: @BeforeStep({ context.step.equals(\"build\") }) void call(context){ /* execute something right before the library step called build is executed. */ } The closure parameter is optional. If omitted, the hook will always be executed. Let’s say we wanted to print to the console log a specific message when the build step fails to execute successfully. Within one of your configured library sources, create a new directory. For this example, let’s call the library slack Repository Structure: README.rst slack/ When creating steps whose only purpose is to be invoked at a particular stage of the pipeline, the name of the step does not matter because it is not being called via a pipeline template. These steps are discovered by JTE and invoked dynamically. This means that if there are multiple steps with the same annotation they will all be executed. This is useful for situations such as creating pipeline templates to be used by multiple teams all using different tools to receive pipeline notifications - or using multiple notification tools (email, slack, sms, etc).

This page explains how to confirm that library parameters, which are field-value pairs passed to a library though its external configuration, are valid. This means confirming any parameters required by your library are supplied, and that all parameters supplied have an acceptable value and/or data type. For example, say your library requires a name for a Jenkins credential, and expects it to be passed through a field in your library’s config called \"credential.\" You would want to ensure when your library is used that: In the aggregated pipeline_config.groovy, there is a \"credential\" field in your library’s configuration The value for that \"credential\" field is a String (since we usually reference Jenkins credentials by a name) Including a library config ( library_config.groovy) in your library is entirely optional. There are other ways to validate parameters, which are covered below. You can validate the parameters passed via pipeline_config.groovy by a library configuration file, or library config. This file, named library_config.groovy, goes at the root of your library and includes a list of required and optional fields, as well as tests you want to apply to those fields. When your library is loaded by a JTE pipeline, each of your library’s parameters from the aggregated pipeline config file are tested according to the contents of the library config. If those tests fail, or there’s an extra field you didn’t specify, the pipeline fails. Here’s an example of a library_config.groovy file: fields{ required{ credential = String mode = [ \"mode1\", \"mode2\" ] } optional{ library_option = ~/[oO]ption\\s*\\d+/ do_optional_thing = Boolean } } In this example, there are two required fields (\"credential\" and \"mode\"), and two optional fields (\"library option\" and \"do_optional_thing\"). The pipeline config is required to provide two parameters: a \"credential\" field with a String value and a \"mode\" field with a value of either \"mode1\" or \"mode2.\" There are also two optional fields: \"library_option\", which must have a value that matches the regex expression /[oO]ption\\s*\\d+/, and \"do_optional_thing\", which must have a Boolean value. Given this example library config, this would be a valid snippet from your aggregated pipeline config: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"credentialA\" mode = \"mode1\" library_option = \"Option123\" } } As would this: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secret-password\" mode = \"mode2\" library_option = \"option 3\" do_optional_thing = true } } Both these snippets have the two required fields, \"credential\" and \"mode,\" and the only other fields are listed as optional in the library config. In addition, the values for each of those fields pass the tests set in the library config. In your library config you specify a list of fields that you expect to be used in your library’s external configuration (i.e. in the pipeline config file). In this list, you must also distinguish between required and optional fields. This list establishes two rules: If a required field is not present in your library’s section of the pipeline configuration, then the pipeline fails If there is any field present in your library’s section of the pipeline configuration that is not listed as either a required or optional field, then the pipeline fails For every field in your library configuration, you must specify a rule that field’s value must conform to. There are currently three types of rules: the value must be a particular data type (Type Match) the value must be one of a set of listed values (Enum Match) the value must match a given regex expression. (Regex Match) If you want to test a parameter is of a particular data type (e.g. boolean, string), you put the name of that data type as the field’s value in the library config. For example, if I want to make sure \"credential\" is of type \"String\", my library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ credential = String } } The current options for data types to test for are: boolean / Boolean String Integer / int Double BigDecimal Float Number If you want to test that a parameter is one a particular set of values, you can put an array of acceptable options as the field’s value in the library config. For example, if you want to make sure the field \"intensity\" is either \"high\", \"medium,\" or \"low,\" your library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ intensity = [\"high\", \"medium\", \"low\"] } } Given this library config, if the \"intensity\" value for your library (set by the pipeline config) isn’t one of those three values, then the pipeline will throw an error. For example, this pipeline config snippet would be valid: libraries{ your_library{ intensity = \"medium\" } } But this snippet would cause an error: libraries{ your_library{ intensity = \"intense\" // throws an error because \"intense\" is neither \"high,\" \"medium\", nor \"low\" } } You can put more than strings into these enum arrays; any type of object will work, and multiple types of objects can be in the same array. If you want to test that a String parameter conforms to a particular pattern, you can put a Regular Expression representing that pattern for the field’s value in the library config. For example, if you want to make sure \"library_option\" is one word with only alphanumeric characters, your library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ credential = ~/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/ } } Given this library config, if the \"credential\" value for your library, set by the pipeline config, doesn’t match the regex expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$, then the pipeline will throw an error. For example, this snippet would be valid: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secretPassword\" } } But this snippet would cause an error: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secret-password\" // throws an error because of the \"-\" } } The parameters for your library in the pipeline config aren’t always in a flat list; it’s common to logically group parameters in submaps. For example, your pipeline config may have a snippet like this: libraries{ your_library{ image{ name = \"your-image\" credential = \"repo-cred\" } web_service{ url = \"https://example.com\" credential = \"service-cred\" options{ optionA = \"foobar\" optionB = 7 optionC = true } } } } The library config is only concerned with the lines that have key-value pairs where the value isn’t another map. For example, you wouldn’t be able to set web_service or web_serivice.options as a required or optional field, but you can set the fields under them, like web_service.credential or web_service.options.optionB as required/optional. Also, if two parameters are grouped under the same field they don’t both have to be required/optional. Continuing with the pipeline_config.groovy example snippet above, you could require optionA and optionB, but not optionC. The resulting library config might look like this: fields{ required{ image{ name = String credential = String } web_service{ url = /^(http|https):\\/\\/.+$/ credential = String options{ optionA = String optionB = Integer } } } optional{ web_service{ options{ optionC = Boolean } } } } You would need to include the whole structure, but you can pick and choose which fields within those submaps are required and which are optional. While using a library configuration covers most libraries' validation requirements, you may wish to do more complex validation, or you may have a particular need that’s not met. For those cases, you can either create a separate pipeline step with the @Validate annotation, or you can validate the parameters within the step itself. In our primary example in how to externalize library configurations, we had a step that took an Integer number parameter, as well as a String message parameter. We assume that: those input parameters are both configured those input parameters are of the correct type To actually validate these assumptions, the following code could be used: void call(){ // define library configuration parameters String error_msg = \"\"\" This step has the following library parameters: number: [Integer] // required message: [String] // required \"\"\" // validate number if (config.number){ if (!(config.number instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" number parameter must be an Integer, received [${config.number}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide number parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // validate message if (config.message){ if (!(config.message instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" message parameter must be a String, received [${config.message}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide message parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // execute step functionality for(def i = 0, i < config.number, i++){ println config.message } } Since your library’s parameters are accessible w/in any step of your library, you can create a separate step that performs the validation, then annotate that step with @validate to run the step when the pipeline starts. Using the same example as above, the code below could be used. @Validate void call(){ // define library configuration parameters String error_msg = \"\"\" This step has the following library parameters: number: [Integer] // required message: [String] // required \"\"\" // validate number if (config.number){ if (!(config.number instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" number parameter must be an Integer, received [${config.number}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide number parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // validate message if (config.message){ if (!(config.message instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" message parameter must be a String, received [${config.message}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide message parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } } arrow_back Exernalizing Library Configuration Leverage Lifecycle Hooks arrow_forward","title":"Validate Library Parameters","component":"jte","version":"1.6","name":"validate_library_parameters","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/library-development/validate_library_parameters.html","titles":[{"text":"The Library Configuration File - Overview","id":"_the_library_configuration_file_overview"},{"text":"Listing Fields","id":"_listing_fields"},{"text":"Validating Parameters","id":"_validating_parameters"},{"text":"Type Match","id":"_type_match"},{"text":"Enum Match","id":"_enum_match"},{"text":"Regex Match","id":"_regex_match"},{"text":"Nested Fields","id":"_nested_fields"},{"text":"Additional Validation Methods","id":"_additional_validation_methods"},{"text":"Validating Within the Step","id":"_validating_within_the_step"},{"text":"Validating in a Separate Step","id":"_validating_in_a_separate_step"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/pipeline-templating/configuration_file_sandboxing.html":{"text":"Jenkins Templating Engine pipeline_config.groovy configuration files are a custom DSL intent on making configuration as user friendly as possible.

The configuration file is a groovy file named pipeline_config.groovy that gets placed at the root of the source code repository or within a pipeline configuration repository. The configuration file is a custom groovy domain specific language intended to avoid the burdensome syntax of JSON without the whitespace pitfalls of YAML. While the flexibility of what can be done within a configuration file is limited by the sandbox, the file is executed as a groovy script and builds a configuration object. The configuration file acts as a nested builder language will accept any arbitrary configuration. Beyond several JTE configuration fields, it is up to specific primitives and libraries to provide meaning to the keys and values provided within a configuration. An example configuration file would be: // restrict individual repository Jenkinsfiles allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false // skip the default JTE checkout and do it explicitly skip_default_checkout = true // define application environment objects application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } /* define libraries to load. available libraries are based upon the library sources configured. */ libraries{ github sonarqube docker // library configurations are determined by // the specific library implementation openshift{ url = \"https://example.openshift.com\" cred_id = \"openshift\" } } By default, if there is a Jenkinsfile in an application source code repository it will be executed as the pipeline template. When using JTE to share a common pipeline template across multiple applications an organization may want to prevent individual repositories from providing their own pipeline templates for governance. To disable this default behavior, specify allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false within a governance tier’s configuration file. For a full overview of how governance works with JTE, check out the Governance Model. The Jenkins Templating Engine is essentially an implementation of the Template Method Design Pattern for Jenkins Pipelines. A template is defined which invokes abstract methods (steps) yet to be defined. These methods are then implemented by either steps from the libraries loaded or the default step implementation. As a result, situations may arise where a step is called from a template that has not been implemented via the available options. In some cases, this is acceptable. The template_methods block of your configuration file is used to declare the steps that will be called from your template. In the event that a step is called that has not been defined, it will be routed to the default step implementation if it’s name appears in the template_methods block. By default, JTE provides the following default values for template_methods. template_methods{ unit_test static_code_analysis build scan_container_image penetration_test accessibility_compliance_test performance_test functional_test } In Jenkins, environment variables are made accessible via the env global variable. This variable is resolvable within your pipeline configuration file. This also means that Build Parameters can be access within the pipeline configuration file as they are stored on the env variable. For example, in the following configuration: pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ someLibrary{ someField = env.buildParam ?: \"default if not set\" } } libraries.someLibrary.someField would resolve to the Build Parameter named buildParam and would default to default if not set if buildParam was not truthy. arrow_back What is a pipeline template?

Whether the application is a Java app packaged as a war and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance or a React app being statically bundled and deployed to an S3 bucket or Nginx instance, the steps in your pipeline are the same. In this example, both applications could have a pipeline workflow that performs unit testing, static code analysis, packaging an artifact, and deploying that artifact to an application environment. You would represent this workflow in a template! Templates are built by calling steps and referencing primitives defined in your pipeline configuration file. Pipeline steps are methods supplied by pipeline libraries that implement a specific action in your pipeline template. In your pipeline configuration file you will specify what libraries should be loaded. Each of these libraries will contribute steps that can be called from your pipeline template. In our simple example, a pipeline template could be defined as follows: unit_test() static_code_analysis() build() deploy_to dev This template could be reused by multiple teams using different tools by creating libraries which implement the pipeline steps unit_test, static_code_analysis, build, and deploy_to. Once these libraries are created, a configuration file is created to specify which libraries to load. For the deployment step, you’ll notice that a dev application environment was referenced to specify where the deployment should take place. This dev application environment is an example of a primitive that can be defined alongside your template in the configuration file. Primitives are template constructs whose purpose is to make the pipeline template as simple and easy to read as possible. The default primitives currently supported are Application Environments, Keywords, and Stages. It is possible to write a Jenkins Plugin that extends the Jenkins Templating Engine to add a custom primitve. Please reach out in the Gitter Channel to discuss if this seems like something you should do. To complete this example, we can build out sample pipeline configuration files for each application. Configuration files provide the information necessary to populate a pipeline template with what’s needed to execute. For our example, we can define a common pipeline configuration to be inherited by both applications that defines the development application environment and a common SonarQube pipeline library to perform the static code analysis: // define common application environment application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" ec2{ ips = [ \"1.2.3.4\", \"1.2.3.5\" ] credential_id = \"ec2_ssh\" } s3{ url = \"https://s3.example.com\" path = \"content/\" credential_id = \"s3_bucket\" } } } // define pipeline libraries common between applications libraries{ merge = true sonarqube // supplies the static_code_analysis step } For the Java application: libraries{ java // supplies the build step junit // supplies the unit_test step ec2 // supplies the deploy_to step } For the React application: libraries{ React // supplies the build step jest // supplies the unit_test step s3 // supplies the deploy_to step } You would then create a Governance Tier to point JTE to your common configuration and place the application specific configurations at the root of their source code repository in a file called pipeline_config.groovy.

The application_environments key is used to begin declaring application environments. Within the application environments block, environments can be defined through subkeys. These subkeys will be used to reference the environment from your pipeline template. By default, application environments accept an optional short_name and long_name configuration. These values will be set to the value of the environment name if not overridden. An example specification defining a dev and prod environment would be: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Then within a pipeline template, assuming there is a pipeline step called deploy_to that accepts an application environment as an argument, you could reference these objects via build() deploy_to dev test() deploy_to prod A created ApplicationEnvironment can determine the previous and next ApplicationEnvironment that’s been defined through the previous and next properties. The first environment’s previous property and the last environment’s next property will be null. These properties are automatically configured. If you try to set the previous and next properties in the environment’s definition an exception will be thrown. For example, defining: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } test{ long_name = \"Test\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } This will create dev, test, and prod objects to be leveraged in your libraries and templates. Then, to validate their context you could create a template such as: // validate dev environment's context assert dev.previous == null assert dev.next == test // validate test environment's context assert test.previous == dev assert test.next == prod // validate prod environment's context assert prod.previous == test assert prod.next == null The Application Environment primitive can also accept an arbitrary number of additional configuration fields. This often comes in handy when libraries provide steps that accept an application environment as an input parameter. Configurations for the library across all environments would be defined in the library spec, while environment specific configurations would be defined on the environment. Suppose there was an ec2 library that accepts a ssh_credential_id configuration that specifies a Jenkins credential ID containing the ssh key to access both instances and an ip configuration supplying the IP for the environment to scp an artifact to. The configuration file for such a situation could be: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" ec2{ ip = \"1.2.3.4\" } } prod{ ec2{ ip = \"1.2.3.5\" } } } libraries{ ec2{ ssh_credential_id = \"ssh_credential\" } } Refer to Library Development for more information on how to build libraries that can leverage this pattern. arrow_back What is a primitive in JTE?

To do this, there has to be a way to organize different implementations of the same step. For example, if two teams are using gradle and maven to build their respective applications via a build step invoked from a template - then there must be a way of storing and labeling these different implementations. That’s where libraries come in. In this example, we would create a maven and gradle library, each contributing a build step via a file called build.groovy. As this example illustrates, you can think of the pipeline templates you create as an api that libraries and primitives implement. Therefore, libraries that are meant to be interchangeable should contribute steps with the same name. This way, multiple teams can use the same pipeline template by specifying different libraries to load in their pipeline configuration file. A Library Source is a reference to a place from which libraries can be found for loading. Following the governance model JTE lays out, Library Sources can be defined globally under Manage Jenkins >> Configure System >> Jenkins Templating Engine and become available to every pipeline on the Jenkins instance. Alternatively, access to libraries can be scoped to jobs within a Folder in Jenkins by defining the Library Source on the Folder. In general, individual libraries are just directories within the configured library source. The library is referenceable in your pipeline_config.groovy file via the directory name. Each groovy file within a library directory (besides the library configuration file) will be loaded as a step invokable from a pipeline template where the step name is equal to the base file name. Libraries can come from different sources. The current two storage mechanisms for libraries are Source Code Repositories and packaging libraries into a separate Jenkins plugin.

It’s a lot less work to configure a source code repository and configure it as a library source. So why would someone want to spend the time packaging their libraries as a Jenkins Plugin? Steps contributed by libraries often rely on Jenkins plugins in their implementation. Packing libraries as a Jenkins Plugin ensures that all other plugin dependencies (and their versions) are satisfied when the library providing plugin is installed. It slows down library loading to reach out to a remote source code repository to retrieve libraries. When libraries are packaged in a Jenkins Plugin, library loading can be sped up significantly. It can be helpful to ensure that specific version of the Templating Engine Plugin is installed if the interface between JTE and libraries is changed. One specific use-case for the Templating Engine Plugin is for DevOps engineers supporting multiple pipelines simultaneously. In these situations, the libraries provided are likely shared across the teams as well. Over time, libraries can be changed in a way that breaks backwards compatibility. Packaging libraries as a plugin allows you to version your set of libraries as an artifact where teams can upgrade when it makes the most operational sense. We have created a sample repository you can use as a launching pad for packaging your libraries as a plugin. Checkout the jte-libs-as-a-plugin repository to get started. If packaging your libraries via a Jenkins Plugin, we recommend configuring your library source as a SCM Library during development. If you’re following the repository template based off of the sample repository mentioned above, you would configure the SCM Library repository URL and set the base directory to src/main/resources/libraries. This way, you can continuously push updates to the remote repository for testing, and only once you’re satisfied with the changes, increment the version and package the libraries as a plugin. arrow_back SCM Library Provider Example Library Walkthrough arrow_forward","title":"Plugin Library Provider","component":"jte","version":"1.6","name":"plugin_library_provider","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.6/library-development/library_sources/plugin_library_provider.html","titles":[{"text":"Why package libraries this way?","id":"_why_package_libraries_this_way"},{"text":"1.

JTE allows you to consolidate pipelines into shareable workflows that define the business logic of your software delivery processes while allowing for optimal pipeline code reuse by pulling out tool specific implementations into library modules. We recommend you watch the recent Jenkins Online Meetup or read Introducing the Jenkins Templating Engine as a starting point to get a feel for what JTE can do for your pipeline development! The Jenkins Templating Engine works off the idea of pipeline templates that define generically what should happen (and when) and accompanying configuration files that populate the template with implementation details. Pipelines are typically defined on a per application basis via a Jenkinsfile in the source code repository. Often, common code can be pulled out into Shared Libraries to reduce code duplication but a few problems remain. Organization’s application portfolios often have a diverse technology stack, each requiring their own pipeline-as-code integrations. It becomes increasingly complex to manage these different implementations across an organization while standardizing on the required software delivery processes. For organizations with strict governance requirements having a Jenkinsfile within the source code repository can allow developers to bypass these mandatory requirements. The real power of JTE comes from creating shareable workflows and using them across teams. JTE allows you to create a centralized hierarchical governance for your pipeline configurations that aligns to your organizational structure. With governance tiers, organizations can accelerate enterprise adoption by creating inheritable pipelines that share common configurations. JTE allows you to share pipeline code effectively across multiple teams through the use of common pipeline libraries. When supporting pipelines for multiple applications it becomes more challenging to maintain the associated complexity. Multiple tech stacks and tool integrations can lead to largely similar Jenkinsfiles with distinct differences around how specific parts of the pipeline function. JTE embraces the traditional software development practices of modularity and separation of concerns to create a more organized code base for your pipelines. At Booz Allen, we created the Jenkins Templating Engine to support our Solutions Delivery Platform; a DevSecOps platform accelerating adoption of modern software development best practices.

Writing pipeline templates and implementing pipeline libraries should remain as syntactically close to writing typical Jenkins pipeline-as-code as possible. The Jenkins Templating Engine simply provides a different way to organize your code to optimize the modularity in order to create tool-agnostic, pipeline templates. Any JTE specific features, such as the config variable exposed to libraries, should be kept as minimal as possible and only exist to facilitate ease of pipeline development within the framework. The Jenkins Templating Engine is first and foremost a pipeline templating framework.

So what exactly do I mean by \"Initialization Process\"? The Initialization Process is what happens between a pipeline run beginning and the user-defined pipeline template being executed. The TemplateEntryPointVariable is where it all starts, specifically the getValue() method. The first thing JTE does is gather all of the Pipeline Configuration Files and merge them together to produce an aggregated pipeline configuration file. That process is as follows. The PipelineConfig class is responsible for storing the aggregated pipeline configuration (represented as a TemplateConfigObject). It also contains the business logic related to merging multiple pipeline configurations. Upon creation, the default pipeline configuration is read from the resources directory. In JTE, a Governance Tier stores a hierarchical pipeline configuration and a list of Library Sources that pipelines under this tier inherit. The Global Governance Tier is configured under Manage Jenkins > Configure System. Subsequent tiers are defined on folders. Therefore, you create governance hierarchies in JTE by creating folder hierarchies and when appropriate, configuring the folder’s Governance Tier with a pipeline configuration file. JTE will aggregate all the pipeline job’s parent pipeline configuration files to produce an aggregated pipeline configuration that will subsequently be used to configure the pipeline for this run. JTE fetches the configured Governance Tiers in order via the static GovernanceTier.getHierarchy(). For each tier, we call tier.getConfig() which returns the parsed result of a pipeline configuration file, a TemplateConfigObject. We then pass this TemplateConfigObject to the PipelineConfig’s join method, which merges the current pipeline configuration with the incoming pipeline configuration and logs the modifications using the TemplateLogger TemplateConfigDSL.parse(String file) is used to translate JTE’s custom configuration DSL into a TemplateConfigObject. The trick to the Jenkins Templating Engine is that pipeline templates get executed just like Jenkinsfiles. It’s just that this initialization process prepares the script environment by populating some variables (called Primitives in JTE) in the script binding before executing the template. In groovy, the script binding is where undeclared variables are stored. It can be thought of as a global key-value store. def x = 1 // variable is declared, and therefore not stored in the binding y = 2 // variable is not declared and stored in the binding y = 2 is the same as saying getBinding().setVariable(\"y\", 2) JTE works because the Jenkins pipelines will execute variables stored in the binding that respond to the call method, a feature introduced here. JTE uses a custom script binding implementation, the TemplateBinding, to prevent loaded Primitives from being overwritten during intialization or accidentally by library developers. Everything JTE populates the binding with (various Primitives and steps loaded from libraries) are extensions of the TemplatePrimitive class. Extending the TemplatePrimitive class is what marks the object as \"protected\" in the TemplateBinding, preventing it from being overridden inadvertently. Each primitive has an associated TemplatePrimitiveInjector that takes the aggregated pipeline configuration, parses it, and creates instances of the primitive to inject it into the binding. At this point, the pipeline’s runtime environment has been appropriately hydrated based upon the aggregated pipeline configuration. We can now execute the TemplateEntryPoint, which optionally checks out the branch source associated with the pipeline, determines the pipeline template, and executes it. arrow_back Developer Documentation","title":"Initialization Process","component":"jte","version":"1.7","name":"initialization","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/developer/initialization.html","titles":[{"text":"Start at the Beginning: TemplateEntryPointVariable","id":"_start_at_the_beginning_templateentrypointvariable"},{"text":"Aggregate the Pipeline Configuration Files","id":"_aggregate_the_pipeline_configuration_files"},{"text":"Create a New PipelineConfig Object","id":"_create_a_new_pipelineconfig_object"},{"text":"Aggregate the Pipeline Configurations","id":"_aggregate_the_pipeline_configurations"},{"text":"Prepare the Binding","id":"_prepare_the_binding"},{"text":"Custom Binding Implementation","id":"_custom_binding_implementation"},{"text":"Calling All Injectors","id":"_calling_all_injectors"},{"text":"Execute the Template","id":"_execute_the_template"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/governance/conditional_inheritance.html":{"text":"The JTE configuration file DSL allows you to build arbitrary nested key-value pair structures.

We will walk through an example of what happens when neither of these flags have been set for a configuration block, as well as the result of adding one of the flags to a block. Let’s say that a Governance Tier has defined the application environments to be used by all applications within it’s purview: Governance Tier Configuration File application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Now let’s assume an application’s configuration file attempts to add their own application environment to the configuration: application_environments{ impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } In this example, the application’s configuration will be ignored because it’s parent configuration has not allowed modifications to the application_environments key Now let’s say the Governance Tier wanted to allow this sort of customization. By setting merge = true within the application_environments block, the Governance Tier is saying that new keys may be added to the block. In this case - this means allowing subconfigurations to append their own application environments. Governance Tier Configuration: application_environments{ merge = true dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Application Configuration File: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } The application configuration has tried to add a new configuration to the dev application environment as well as add their own impl environment. Resultant Configuration: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } By setting merge = true the Governance Tier has allowed new keys to be added to the application_environments block. This meant that the impl application environment was added as a new key but the modification to the dev environment was ignored. To allow this as well, the Governance Tier would specify merge = true within the dev block. If the Governance Tier in this example was setting application environments as reasonable defaults but was not interested in enforcing the use of these environments, they could allow application configurations to take precedence by setting override = true in the application_environments block. Governance Tier Configuration: application_environments{ override = true dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Application Configuration File: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } Resultant Configuration: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Dev\" random_new_field = 3 } impl{ long_name = \"Implementation\" } } You’ll notice that the resultant configuration equals that of the application’s configuration.

Through this mechanism, arbitrarily complex configuration hierarchies can be created based upon how jobs are laid out on the Jenkins instance. Let’s take a look at an example: Each time Job B is run, if present, the Pipeline Configurations from the Global Governance Tier, Folder 1, and the job itself will be aggregated in that order.

When this step is executed, the pipeline will have access to the primitives that have been defined via the aggregated result of the specified pipeline configuration files as well as any steps that have been contributed by loaded libraries. The real power in the Jenkins Templating Engine is that it allows you to externalize the Jenkinsfile from an individual source code repository, and generalize it to be used by multiple teams simultaneously. This means that the default way to define a Template is externally in a source code repository via a Governance Tier. This is exactly what happens when you invoke the template step directly with no parameters via template(). When no parameters are passed, the pipeline configuration files defined on each Governance Tier are aggregated. This aggregated configuration is then used to initialize the Template’s environment with the various Primitives that were defined as well as load any libraries that have been configured. The template step itself takes an optional Closure parameter. This Closure parameter is most often used for testing, though if governance is not a factor it works just as well as defining your pipeline template externally. Let’s assume that you are running a typical Jenkinsfile and want to invoke the template step directly. You have configured a Governance Tier that will load a library contributing a build() step. Executing this build step then, can be done by trying to invoke it from within the context of the template step as follows: /* here you do not have access to the build step because it has not been loaded yet */ template{ /* now that you are within the context of the template step, the library will have been loaded and you will be able to execute the build step */ build() } When a Closure is passed to the template step - we do not look for a template, regardless if a Governance Tier specifies what template should be used.

When writing a library step, a config variable comes autowired into your scope that can be referenced to access configurations defined in your library block from the configuration file. Let’s create a configuration parameter number to represent the number of times to print the message and a configuration parameter message to represent the message to be printed. pipeline_config.groovy: libraries{ example{ number = 3 message = \"my message to be printed!\" } } We can now write our library step to access these parameters directly on the config variable automatically provided to the step.

Creating a Library is as easy as creating a root level directory within your configured Library Source’s source code repository. An example repository structure could be: README.rst example_library/ The library is named and is referenceable by the directory name. To create a step, create a .groovy file within the library directory. The step name will be that of the basename of the file. For example, to create a build step, add a build.groovy file: README.rst example_library/ build.groovy In most cases, writing a step is done by defining a call method within the groovy step file created. This call method can take input arguments and return objects. Within the step you can execute any old regular Jenkins pipeline code, including invoking other steps defined by loaded libraries. Let’s say you wanted this build step to run mvn clean verify, your build.groovy file could be: void call(){ node{ sh \"mvn clean verify\" } } Steps, like regular global variables in Jenkins Shared Libraries, can define methods other than call. See an example here. With a directory created called example_library within your Library Source, you can now load this library from your pipeline configuration to make the steps contained therein accessible from your pipeline template. pipeline_config.groovy: libraries{ example_library } With the example_library library loaded via your pipeline configuration file, you can then invoke the build step from a pipeline template via: build() which will execute the shell command defined in the step. Now that you know the basics of how to create a library, populate the library with steps, reference them from your pipeline configuration file, and invoke the step from a pipeline template you can now move on to some of the more advanced library development concepts: Table 1.

For example, if you wanted to send multiple notification types after a particular pipeline step or at the conclusion of a pipeline if the build was failure. JTE supports this type of Aspect Oriented Programming style event handling through annotation markers that can be placed on library steps. The following lifecycle hook annotations are available: Table 1. JTE LifeCycle Hook annotations Annotation Description @Validate Will get executed at the beginning of a pipeline run, should throw exception if this step does not have its prerequesites @Init Will get executed at the beginning of a pipeline run, after Validate @BeforeStep Will get executed before every pipeline step invocation @AfterStep Will get executed after every pipeline step invocation @CleanUp Will get executed at the end of a pipeline run @Notify Will get executed after every pipeline step invocation as well as at the end of the pipeline run In order to write a pipeline step leveraging one of these lifecycle hooks, you must annotate the step with the annotation and accept a context input parameter to the method. This context parameter provides context so that the step can vary its behavior based on what just happened in the pipeline. Table 2. JTE LifeCycle Hook Context Parameter Variable Description context.library The name of the Library that contributed the step associated with the hook context.step The name of the Step associated with the hook context.status The current pipeline build status context.library and context.step will be null before and after pipeline execution and are only to be leveraged by @BeforeStep, @AfterStep, and @Notify The reference to the variable name context makes the assumption that you’ve named the input parameter to the step with the hook annotation context. In practice, this variable name can be whatever you please Sometimes you’ll only want to invoke the Hook when certain conditions are met, such as a build failure or in relation to another step (like before static code analysis). Each annotation accepts a Closure parameter. If the return object of this closure is true http://www.groovy-lang.org/semantics.html#Groovy-Truth then the hook will be executed. While executing, the code within the Closure will be able to resolve the context variable described above as well as the library configuration variable config. Example Syntax: @BeforeStep({ context.step.equals(\"build\") }) void call(context){ /* execute something right before the library step called build is executed. */ } The closure parameter is optional. If omitted, the hook will always be executed. Let’s say we wanted to print to the console log a specific message when the build step fails to execute successfully. Within one of your configured library sources, create a new directory. For this example, let’s call the library slack Repository Structure: README.rst slack/ When creating steps whose only purpose is to be invoked at a particular stage of the pipeline, the name of the step does not matter because it is not being called via a pipeline template. These steps are discovered by JTE and invoked dynamically. This means that if there are multiple steps with the same annotation they will all be executed. This is useful for situations such as creating pipeline templates to be used by multiple teams all using different tools to receive pipeline notifications - or using multiple notification tools (email, slack, sms, etc). For this example, we’ll call the step sendSlackNotification. README.rst slack/ sendSlackNotification.groovy We must remember to annotate the method and pass the step a context input parameter. Remember, our goal is to create a step that sends a message when the build step fails. sendSlackNotification.groovy: @AfterStep({ context.step.equals(\"build\") && context.status.equals(\"FAILURE\") }) void call(context){ slackSend color: '#ff0000', message: \"Build Failure: ${env.JOB_URL}\" } This example assumes you’ve installed and appropriately configured the Slack Notification Plugin. With the library created and slack notification step written all you haveto do to send a slack notification after the build step fails is load the slack library in your pipeline configuration file. libraries{ slack } JTE will automatically pick up that a library has been loaded that contributes steps with lifecycle hook annotations. arrow_back Validate Library Parameters Multi-Method Steps arrow_forward","title":"Leverage Lifecycle Hooks","component":"jte","version":"1.7","name":"lifecycle_hooks","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/library-development/lifecycle_hooks.html","titles":[{"text":"Implementation","id":"_implementation"},{"text":"Conditional Execution","id":"_conditional_execution"},{"text":"Example Implementation","id":"_example_implementation"},{"text":"Step 1: Create a Library","id":"_step_1_create_a_library"},{"text":"Step 2: Create the Step","id":"_step_2_create_the_step"},{"text":"Step 3: Load the Library","id":"_step_3_load_the_library"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/library-development/multimethod_steps.html":{"text":"It is sometimes advantageous to define more steps than just the call method.

This page explains how to confirm that library parameters, which are field-value pairs passed to a library though its external configuration, are valid. This means confirming any parameters required by your library are supplied, and that all parameters supplied have an acceptable value and/or data type. For example, say your library requires a name for a Jenkins credential, and expects it to be passed through a field in your library’s config called \"credential.\" You would want to ensure when your library is used that: In the aggregated pipeline_config.groovy, there is a \"credential\" field in your library’s configuration The value for that \"credential\" field is a String (since we usually reference Jenkins credentials by a name) Including a library config ( library_config.groovy) in your library is entirely optional. There are other ways to validate parameters, which are covered below. You can validate the parameters passed via pipeline_config.groovy by a library configuration file, or library config. This file, named library_config.groovy, goes at the root of your library and includes a list of required and optional fields, as well as tests you want to apply to those fields. When your library is loaded by a JTE pipeline, each of your library’s parameters from the aggregated pipeline config file are tested according to the contents of the library config. If those tests fail, or there’s an extra field you didn’t specify, the pipeline fails. Here’s an example of a library_config.groovy file: fields{ required{ credential = String mode = [ \"mode1\", \"mode2\" ] } optional{ library_option = ~/[oO]ption\\s*\\d+/ do_optional_thing = Boolean } } In this example, there are two required fields (\"credential\" and \"mode\"), and two optional fields (\"library option\" and \"do_optional_thing\"). The pipeline config is required to provide two parameters: a \"credential\" field with a String value and a \"mode\" field with a value of either \"mode1\" or \"mode2.\" There are also two optional fields: \"library_option\", which must have a value that matches the regex expression /[oO]ption\\s*\\d+/, and \"do_optional_thing\", which must have a Boolean value. Given this example library config, this would be a valid snippet from your aggregated pipeline config: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"credentialA\" mode = \"mode1\" library_option = \"Option123\" } } As would this: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secret-password\" mode = \"mode2\" library_option = \"option 3\" do_optional_thing = true } } Both these snippets have the two required fields, \"credential\" and \"mode,\" and the only other fields are listed as optional in the library config. In addition, the values for each of those fields pass the tests set in the library config. In your library config you specify a list of fields that you expect to be used in your library’s external configuration (i.e. in the pipeline config file). In this list, you must also distinguish between required and optional fields. This list establishes two rules: If a required field is not present in your library’s section of the pipeline configuration, then the pipeline fails If there is any field present in your library’s section of the pipeline configuration that is not listed as either a required or optional field, then the pipeline fails For every field in your library configuration, you must specify a rule that field’s value must conform to. There are currently three types of rules: the value must be a particular data type (Type Match) the value must be one of a set of listed values (Enum Match) the value must match a given regex expression. (Regex Match) If you want to test a parameter is of a particular data type (e.g. boolean, string), you put the name of that data type as the field’s value in the library config. For example, if I want to make sure \"credential\" is of type \"String\", my library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ credential = String } } The current options for data types to test for are: boolean / Boolean String Integer / int Double BigDecimal Float Number If you want to test that a parameter is one a particular set of values, you can put an array of acceptable options as the field’s value in the library config. For example, if you want to make sure the field \"intensity\" is either \"high\", \"medium,\" or \"low,\" your library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ intensity = [\"high\", \"medium\", \"low\"] } } Given this library config, if the \"intensity\" value for your library (set by the pipeline config) isn’t one of those three values, then the pipeline will throw an error. For example, this pipeline config snippet would be valid: libraries{ your_library{ intensity = \"medium\" } } But this snippet would cause an error: libraries{ your_library{ intensity = \"intense\" // throws an error because \"intense\" is neither \"high,\" \"medium\", nor \"low\" } } You can put more than strings into these enum arrays; any type of object will work, and multiple types of objects can be in the same array. If you want to test that a String parameter conforms to a particular pattern, you can put a Regular Expression representing that pattern for the field’s value in the library config. For example, if you want to make sure \"library_option\" is one word with only alphanumeric characters, your library_config.groovy would contain: fields{ required{ credential = ~/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/ } } Given this library config, if the \"credential\" value for your library, set by the pipeline config, doesn’t match the regex expression ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$, then the pipeline will throw an error. For example, this snippet would be valid: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secretPassword\" } } But this snippet would cause an error: libraries{ your_library{ credential = \"secret-password\" // throws an error because of the \"-\" } } The parameters for your library in the pipeline config aren’t always in a flat list; it’s common to logically group parameters in submaps. For example, your pipeline config may have a snippet like this: libraries{ your_library{ image{ name = \"your-image\" credential = \"repo-cred\" } web_service{ url = \"https://example.com\" credential = \"service-cred\" options{ optionA = \"foobar\" optionB = 7 optionC = true } } } } The library config is only concerned with the lines that have key-value pairs where the value isn’t another map. For example, you wouldn’t be able to set web_service or web_serivice.options as a required or optional field, but you can set the fields under them, like web_service.credential or web_service.options.optionB as required/optional. Also, if two parameters are grouped under the same field they don’t both have to be required/optional. Continuing with the pipeline_config.groovy example snippet above, you could require optionA and optionB, but not optionC. The resulting library config might look like this: fields{ required{ image{ name = String credential = String } web_service{ url = /^(http|https):\\/\\/.+$/ credential = String options{ optionA = String optionB = Integer } } } optional{ web_service{ options{ optionC = Boolean } } } } You would need to include the whole structure, but you can pick and choose which fields within those submaps are required and which are optional. While using a library configuration covers most libraries' validation requirements, you may wish to do more complex validation, or you may have a particular need that’s not met. For those cases, you can either create a separate pipeline step with the @Validate annotation, or you can validate the parameters within the step itself. In our primary example in how to externalize library configurations, we had a step that took an Integer number parameter, as well as a String message parameter. We assume that: those input parameters are both configured those input parameters are of the correct type To actually validate these assumptions, the following code could be used: void call(){ // define library configuration parameters String error_msg = \"\"\" This step has the following library parameters: number: [Integer] // required message: [String] // required \"\"\" // validate number if (config.number){ if (!(config.number instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" number parameter must be an Integer, received [${config.number}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide number parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // validate message if (config.message){ if (!(config.message instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" message parameter must be a String, received [${config.message}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide message parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // execute step functionality for(def i = 0, i < config.number, i++){ println config.message } } Since your library’s parameters are accessible w/in any step of your library, you can create a separate step that performs the validation, then annotate that step with @validate to run the step when the pipeline starts. Using the same example as above, the code below could be used. @Validate void call(){ // define library configuration parameters String error_msg = \"\"\" This step has the following library parameters: number: [Integer] // required message: [String] // required \"\"\" // validate number if (config.number){ if (!(config.number instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" number parameter must be an Integer, received [${config.number}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide number parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } // validate message if (config.message){ if (!(config.message instanceof Integer)){ error \"\"\" message parameter must be a String, received [${config.message}] -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } }else{ error \"\"\" must provide message parameter -- ${error_msg} \"\"\" } } arrow_back Exernalizing Library Configuration Leverage Lifecycle Hooks arrow_forward","title":"Validate Library Parameters","component":"jte","version":"1.7","name":"validate_library_parameters","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/library-development/validate_library_parameters.html","titles":[{"text":"The Library Configuration File - Overview","id":"_the_library_configuration_file_overview"},{"text":"Listing Fields","id":"_listing_fields"},{"text":"Validating Parameters","id":"_validating_parameters"},{"text":"Type Match","id":"_type_match"},{"text":"Enum Match","id":"_enum_match"},{"text":"Regex Match","id":"_regex_match"},{"text":"Nested Fields","id":"_nested_fields"},{"text":"Additional Validation Methods","id":"_additional_validation_methods"},{"text":"Validating Within the Step","id":"_validating_within_the_step"},{"text":"Validating in a Separate Step","id":"_validating_in_a_separate_step"}]},"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/pipeline-templating/configuration_file_sandboxing.html":{"text":"Jenkins Templating Engine pipeline_config.groovy configuration files are a custom DSL intent on making configuration as user friendly as possible.

The configuration file is a groovy file named pipeline_config.groovy that gets placed at the root of the source code repository or within a pipeline configuration repository. The configuration file is a custom groovy domain specific language intended to avoid the burdensome syntax of JSON without the whitespace pitfalls of YAML. While the flexibility of what can be done within a configuration file is limited by the sandbox, the file is executed as a groovy script and builds a configuration object. The configuration file acts as a nested builder language will accept any arbitrary configuration. Beyond several JTE configuration fields, it is up to specific primitives and libraries to provide meaning to the keys and values provided within a configuration. An example configuration file would be: // restrict individual repository Jenkinsfiles allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false // skip the default JTE checkout and do it explicitly skip_default_checkout = true // define application environment objects application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } /* define libraries to load. available libraries are based upon the library sources configured. */ libraries{ github sonarqube docker // library configurations are determined by // the specific library implementation openshift{ url = \"https://example.openshift.com\" cred_id = \"openshift\" } } By default, if there is a Jenkinsfile in an application source code repository it will be executed as the pipeline template. When using JTE to share a common pipeline template across multiple applications an organization may want to prevent individual repositories from providing their own pipeline templates for governance. To disable this default behavior, specify allow_scm_jenkinsfile = false within a governance tier’s configuration file. For a full overview of how governance works with JTE, check out the Governance Model. The Jenkins Templating Engine is essentially an implementation of the Template Method Design Pattern for Jenkins Pipelines. A template is defined which invokes abstract methods (steps) yet to be defined. These methods are then implemented by either steps from the libraries loaded or the default step implementation. As a result, situations may arise where a step is called from a template that has not been implemented via the available options. In some cases, this is acceptable. The template_methods block of your configuration file is used to declare the steps that will be called from your template. In the event that a step is called that has not been defined, it will be routed to the default step implementation if it’s name appears in the template_methods block. By default, JTE provides the following default values for template_methods. template_methods{ unit_test static_code_analysis build scan_container_image penetration_test accessibility_compliance_test performance_test functional_test } In Jenkins, environment variables are made accessible via the env global variable. This variable is resolvable within your pipeline configuration file. This also means that Build Parameters can be access within the pipeline configuration file as they are stored on the env variable. For example, in the following configuration: pipeline_config.groovy libraries{ someLibrary{ someField = env.buildParam ?: \"default if not set\" } } libraries.someLibrary.someField would resolve to the Build Parameter named buildParam and would default to default if not set if buildParam was not truthy. arrow_back What is a pipeline template?

Whether the application is a Java app packaged as a war and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance or a React app being statically bundled and deployed to an S3 bucket or Nginx instance, the steps in your pipeline are the same. In this example, both applications could have a pipeline workflow that performs unit testing, static code analysis, packaging an artifact, and deploying that artifact to an application environment. You would represent this workflow in a template! Templates are built by calling steps and referencing primitives defined in your pipeline configuration file. Pipeline steps are methods supplied by pipeline libraries that implement a specific action in your pipeline template. In your pipeline configuration file you will specify what libraries should be loaded. Each of these libraries will contribute steps that can be called from your pipeline template. In our simple example, a pipeline template could be defined as follows: unit_test() static_code_analysis() build() deploy_to dev This template could be reused by multiple teams using different tools by creating libraries which implement the pipeline steps unit_test, static_code_analysis, build, and deploy_to. Once these libraries are created, a configuration file is created to specify which libraries to load. For the deployment step, you’ll notice that a dev application environment was referenced to specify where the deployment should take place. This dev application environment is an example of a primitive that can be defined alongside your template in the configuration file. Primitives are template constructs whose purpose is to make the pipeline template as simple and easy to read as possible. The default primitives currently supported are Application Environments, Keywords, and Stages. It is possible to write a Jenkins Plugin that extends the Jenkins Templating Engine to add a custom primitve. Please reach out in the Gitter Channel to discuss if this seems like something you should do. To complete this example, we can build out sample pipeline configuration files for each application. Configuration files provide the information necessary to populate a pipeline template with what’s needed to execute. For our example, we can define a common pipeline configuration to be inherited by both applications that defines the development application environment and a common SonarQube pipeline library to perform the static code analysis: // define common application environment application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" ec2{ ips = [ \"1.2.3.4\", \"1.2.3.5\" ] credential_id = \"ec2_ssh\" } s3{ url = \"https://s3.example.com\" path = \"content/\" credential_id = \"s3_bucket\" } } } // define pipeline libraries common between applications libraries{ merge = true sonarqube // supplies the static_code_analysis step } For the Java application: libraries{ java // supplies the build step junit // supplies the unit_test step ec2 // supplies the deploy_to step } For the React application: libraries{ React // supplies the build step jest // supplies the unit_test step s3 // supplies the deploy_to step } You would then create a Governance Tier to point JTE to your common configuration and place the application specific configurations at the root of their source code repository in a file called pipeline_config.groovy.

The application_environments key is used to begin declaring application environments. Within the application environments block, environments can be defined through subkeys. These subkeys will be used to reference the environment from your pipeline template. By default, application environments accept an optional short_name and long_name configuration. These values will be set to the value of the environment name if not overridden. An example specification defining a dev and prod environment would be: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } Then within a pipeline template, assuming there is a pipeline step called deploy_to that accepts an application environment as an argument, you could reference these objects via build() deploy_to dev test() deploy_to prod A created ApplicationEnvironment can determine the previous and next ApplicationEnvironment that’s been defined through the previous and next properties. The first environment’s previous property and the last environment’s next property will be null. These properties are automatically configured. If you try to set the previous and next properties in the environment’s definition an exception will be thrown. For example, defining: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" } test{ long_name = \"Test\" } prod{ long_name = \"Production\" } } This will create dev, test, and prod objects to be leveraged in your libraries and templates. Then, to validate their context you could create a template such as: // validate dev environment's context assert dev.previous == null assert dev.next == test // validate test environment's context assert test.previous == dev assert test.next == prod // validate prod environment's context assert prod.previous == test assert prod.next == null The Application Environment primitive can also accept an arbitrary number of additional configuration fields. This often comes in handy when libraries provide steps that accept an application environment as an input parameter. Configurations for the library across all environments would be defined in the library spec, while environment specific configurations would be defined on the environment. Suppose there was an ec2 library that accepts a ssh_credential_id configuration that specifies a Jenkins credential ID containing the ssh key to access both instances and an ip configuration supplying the IP for the environment to scp an artifact to. The configuration file for such a situation could be: application_environments{ dev{ long_name = \"Development\" ec2{ ip = \"1.2.3.4\" } } prod{ ec2{ ip = \"1.2.3.5\" } } } libraries{ ec2{ ssh_credential_id = \"ssh_credential\" } } Refer to Library Development for more information on how to build libraries that can leverage this pattern. arrow_back What is a primitive in JTE?

To do this, there has to be a way to organize different implementations of the same step. For example, if two teams are using gradle and maven to build their respective applications via a build step invoked from a template - then there must be a way of storing and labeling these different implementations. That’s where libraries come in. In this example, we would create a maven and gradle library, each contributing a build step via a file called build.groovy. As this example illustrates, you can think of the pipeline templates you create as an api that libraries and primitives implement. Therefore, libraries that are meant to be interchangeable should contribute steps with the same name. This way, multiple teams can use the same pipeline template by specifying different libraries to load in their pipeline configuration file. A Library Source is a reference to a place from which libraries can be found for loading. Following the governance model JTE lays out, Library Sources can be defined globally under Manage Jenkins >> Configure System >> Jenkins Templating Engine and become available to every pipeline on the Jenkins instance. Alternatively, access to libraries can be scoped to jobs within a Folder in Jenkins by defining the Library Source on the Folder. In general, individual libraries are just directories within the configured library source. The library is referenceable in your pipeline_config.groovy file via the directory name. Each groovy file within a library directory (besides the library configuration file) will be loaded as a step invokable from a pipeline template where the step name is equal to the base file name. Libraries can come from different sources. The current two storage mechanisms for libraries are Source Code Repositories and packaging libraries into a separate Jenkins plugin. Both of these options have benefits and draw backs that are outlined on their respective pages. Table 1.

When a library-providing plugin has been installed, a new option becomes available when selecting a library source: After selecting From a Library Providing Plugin, just select the library providing plugin from the autopopulated dropdown list. It’s a lot less work to configure a source code repository and configure it as a library source. So why would someone want to spend the time packaging their libraries as a Jenkins Plugin? Steps contributed by libraries often rely on Jenkins plugins in their implementation. Packing libraries as a Jenkins Plugin ensures that all other plugin dependencies (and their versions) are satisfied when the library providing plugin is installed. It slows down library loading to reach out to a remote source code repository to retrieve libraries. When libraries are packaged in a Jenkins Plugin, library loading can be sped up significantly. It can be helpful to ensure that specific version of the Templating Engine Plugin is installed if the interface between JTE and libraries is changed. One specific use-case for the Templating Engine Plugin is for DevOps engineers supporting multiple pipelines simultaneously. In these situations, the libraries provided are likely shared across the teams as well. Over time, libraries can be changed in a way that breaks backwards compatibility. Packaging libraries as a plugin allows you to version your set of libraries as an artifact where teams can upgrade when it makes the most operational sense. We have created a sample repository you can use as a launching pad for packaging your libraries as a plugin. Checkout the jte-libs-as-a-plugin repository to get started. If packaging your libraries via a Jenkins Plugin, we recommend configuring your library source as a SCM Library during development. If you’re following the repository template based off of the sample repository mentioned above, you would configure the SCM Library repository URL and set the base directory to src/main/resources/libraries. This way, you can continuously push updates to the remote repository for testing, and only once you’re satisfied with the changes, increment the version and package the libraries as a plugin. arrow_back SCM Library Provider Example Library Walkthrough arrow_forward","title":"Plugin Library Provider","component":"jte","version":"1.7","name":"plugin_library_provider","url":"/sdp-docs/jte/1.7/library-development/library_sources/plugin_library_provider.html","titles":[{"text":"Why package libraries this way?","id":"_why_package_libraries_this_way"},{"text":"1.

The Jenkins pipeline-as-code that is developed to perform various tool integrations is largely undifferentiated. That is to say, it doesn’t really matter what project you’re working on - the pipeline code that’s written can be reused anywhere if the configuration is appropriately externalized. These libraries serve as an open source, reusable portfolio of tool integrations that can help us speak a common language and leverage a common framework when implementing CI/CD pipelines. Maintaining tool installations on a Jenkins instance can be a configuration management nightmare. Trying to keep straight 3 different versions of Java, Maven, Ant, Gradle, and so on within your Jenkins instance quickly leads to a bloated and difficult to maintain instance. Furthermore, when tools are installed directly on Jenkins build agents it can be difficult to rapidly introduce new features to the pipeline. We use container images to decouple the Jenkins infrastructure from the tools that the pipeline needs for building, testing, and deploying applications. Each library, rather than direclty invoke a tool, will leverage helpers from the sdp library to execute portions of the pipeline inside of container images. These images can be found in the Booz Allen SDP Images GitHub Repository and are hosted through the GitHub Package Registry. If using the SDP Pipeline Libraries as a Library Source for your pipeline, then you must include the sdp library. This library containers helper functions such as inside_sdp_image() to facilitate the use of the SDP Pipeline Container Images as run time environments.

Steps Step Description deploy_to() Performs a deployment using Helm ephemeral(Closure body, ApplicationEnvironment) Creates a short-lived application environment for testing The configurations for the Kubernetes library can be specified in the library spec or on a per application environment. The Kubernetetes Credential is the Jenkins credential defined as a Secrets file that holds the kubeconfig fie contents with access information to the kubernetes target environments. The Kubernetes Context is the context within the kubeconfig that should be used to identify the target environment for deployment. You would specify this as follows: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" k8s_context = \"test\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" k8s_credential = \"cluster1-config\" k8s_context = \"production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ k8s_credential = \"cluster2-config\" k8s_context = \"dev\" } } With this configuration, dev context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to dev and the test context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to test while production context within the cluster1-config would be used when deploying to prod. Together k8s_credential and k8s_context uniquely identify the target environment for deployment. We use Helm for a deployment mechanism to Kubernetes. Helm is a package manager and templating engine for Kubernetes manifests. Using Helm, the typical YAML manifests used to deploy to Kubernetes distributions can be templatized for reuse. In our case, a different values file is used for each static application environment. Deploy the Tiller Server Instead of using Helm as a package manager by bundling the charts and deploying them to a chart repository, we instead use a configuration repository as our Infrastructure as Code mechanism. Create Helm Configuration Repository You’ll need to create a GitHub repository to store the helm chart for your application(s). See the helm docs on provisioning a new chart to get intialize the repository with the skeleton for your chart. How you choose to build your helm chart is up to you, you can put every api object in the templates directory or have subcharts for each individual microservice. SDP doesn’t care, as all it does is clone the github repository and deploy the chart using the specified values file. Values File Conventions Given that we tag container images using the git SHA, SDP will clone your helm configuration repository and update a key corresponding to the current version of each container image for each application environment. As such, a certain syntax is required in your values file. You must have an image_shas key. SDP will automatically add subkeys for each repositories under this image_shas with a value that is the git SHA. Given that YAML keys can’t have hyphens, hyphens in repository names will be replaced with underscores. image_shas: my_sample_application: abcdefgh another_repo: abcdef you can add whatever other keys are necessary to appropriately parameterize your helm chart. Helm Configurations for the Library The helm configuration repository, github credential, tiller credential namespace can be configured globally in the library spec and overriden for specific application environments. The values file to will default to values.${app_env.short_name}.yaml, or can be overridden via app_env.chart_values_file. The name of the release will default to app_env.short_name, or can be overridden via app_env.tiller_release_name An example of helm configurations: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" chart_values_file = \"dev_values.yaml\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" tiller_release_name = \"banana\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller-prod\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller\" } } It’s often beneficial to build a container image once, and then promote that image through different application environments. This makes it possible to test the content of an image once in a lower environment, and remain confident that the results of those tests would be the same as an image is promoted. Promoting images also speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, as building a container image is often the most time-consuming part of the pipeline. By default, the deploy_to() step of the kubernetes pipeline library will promote a container image if it can expect one to exist, which is when the most recent code change was a merge into the given code branch. The image would be expected to be built from an earlier commit, or while there was an open PR. You can override this default for the entire pipeline by setting the promote_previous_image config setting to false. You can also choose whether or not to promote images for each application environment individually through the promote_previous_image application_environment setting. This app_env setting takes priority over the config setting. An example of these settings' usage: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" promote_previous_image = false } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller\" k8s_credential = \"cluster1-config\" k8s_context = \"staging\" promote_previous_image = true //note: making this setting true is redundant, since true is the default } } Table 2.

Values File Conventions Given that we tag container images using the git SHA, SDP will clone your helm configuration repository and update a key corresponding to the current version of each container image for each application environment. As such, a certain syntax is required in your values file. You must have an image_shas key. SDP will automatically add subkeys for each repositories under this image_shas with a value that is the git SHA. Given that YAML keys can’t have hypens, hyphens in repository names will be replaced with underscores. image_shas: my_sample_application: abcdefgh another_repo: abcdef you can add whatever other keys are necessary to appropriately parameterize your helm chart. Helm Configurations for the Library The helm configuration repository, github credential, tiller namespace, and tiller credential can be configured globally in the library spec and overriden for specific application environments. The values file to will default to values.${app_env.short_name}.yaml, or can be overridden via app_env.chart_values_file. The name of the release will default to app_env.short_name, or can be overridden via app_env.tiller_release_name An example of helm configurations: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" chart_values_file = \"dev_values.yaml\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" tiller_release_name = \"banana\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller-prod\" tiller_credential = \"rhs-tiller-prod\" } } libraries{ openshift{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller\" tiller_credential = \"rhs-tiller\" } } It’s often beneficial to build a container image once, and then promote that image through different application environments. This makes it possible to test the content of an image once in a lower environment, and remain confident that the results of those tests would be the same as an image is promoted. Promoting images also speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, as building a container image is often the most time-consuming part of the pipeline. By default, the deploy_to() step of the Openshift pipeline library will promote a container image if it can expect one to exist, which is when the most recent code change was a merge into the given code branch. The image would be expected to be built from an earlier commit, or while there was an open PR. You can override this default for the entire pipeline by setting the promote_previous_image config setting to false. You can also choose whether or not to promote images for each application environment individually through the promote_previous_image application_environment setting. This app_env setting takes priority over the config setting. An example of these settings' usage: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" promote_previous_image = false } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" } } libraries{ openshift{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" tiller_namespace = \"rhs-tiller\" tiller_credential = \"rhs-tiller\" promote_previous_image = true //note: making this setting true is redundant, since true is the default } } Table 2.

This threshold is set with the \"cvss_threshold\" configuration option. For example, if cvss_threshold is set to 7, and a vulnerabily with a CVSS score of 7.5 is detected, the pipeline will fail. If the vulnerability remains, but the cvss_threshold is set to 9, the pipeline will pass the OWASP Dependency Check scan.

Q: What’s the difference between explicitlyMockPipelineStep and explicitlyMockPipelineVariable? A: Practically speaking, the difference is you can omit \".call\" for explicitlyMockPipelineStep() when you use getPipelineMock() In the example above, I used explicitlyMockPipelineStep()` to mock error. Because of that, if I want to see if the error pipeline step is run, I use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error\"). If I were to create the mock using explicitlyMockPipelineVariable() I would instead use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error.call\") There may be some additional differences as well, so try to use what makes the most sense Q: What if I don’t know exactly what the parameters are going to be? A: There are ways to match parameters to regex expressions, as well as test parameters individually The standard format for interaction-based tests are * getPipelineMock()() While you can put the exact parameter value in the second parentheses, you can also run arbitrary groovy code inside curly brackets. Whether or not it’s a \"match\" depends on if that code returns true or false. A good example is in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy. Use it to get the value of the parameter. 1 * getPipelineMock(\"sh\")({it =~ / (zap-cli open-url) Kirk (.+)/}) Q: Do I have to do interaction-based testing? A: No, but you can’t get variables the same way as traditional Spock tests This is because the script gets run in that loadPipelineScriptForTest object. You can only access variables stored in the binding, which are few. It makes more sense to see how variables are being used in pipeline steps, and make sure those pipeline steps use the correct value for those variables. Similarly, if you need to control how a variable is set, you need to stub whatever method or pipeline step that sets the initial value for that variable As an example, in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy, the target variable in penetration_test.groovy is tested by checking the parameters to an sh step. Q: I keep getting \"can’t run method foo() on null; what do I do?\" A: You need to find a way to stub the method that sets the value for the object that calls foo() There should be an example in GetImagesToBuildSpec.groovy (in the docker-unit-tests branch at the time of writing) arrow_back Test Execution docker arrow_forward","title":"FAQ","component":"sdp-libraries","version":"1.2","name":"faq","url":"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/1.2/unit_testing/faq.html","titles":[]},"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/1.2/unit_testing/index.html":{"text":"The purpose of writing unit tests for pipeline libraries is to confirm that they function the way we expect.

If the library doesn’t already exist, doesn’t make sense as an addition to an existing library, and represents a usecase that will be applicable outside of your current situation then it’s likely a good candidate for contribution! This project follows a standard Fork Contribution Model, so if you havent, go ahead and fork the SDP Pipeline Libraries Repository.

The name should be all lowercase, snake_case, and the same as the tool or process being integrated. Of course, ensure this tool has # from the root of the repository mkdir libraries/ Go on over to JTE’s Library Development documentation to learn how to create libraries. There are a few conventions the SDP Pipeline Libraries have adopted, outlined below: The SDP library exists to implement common functionality required by the other libraries. It’s worthwhile to see if any of those steps are going to be useful to you during library development. The SDP Pipeline Libraries try to install as few plugins on the Jenkins instance and as few tools on the underlying infrastructure as possible. We run portions of the pipeline inside container images, leveraging them as runtime pipeline environments. The existing container images used for this purpose can be found in the SDP Pipeline Images repository. If your library requires runtime dependencies, like a CLI, capture them in a container image and open a PR to the SDP Pipeline Images repository. In your step implementations, the image that is to be used should be overridable but default to the image hosted via GitHub Package Registry on the SDP Pipeline Images repository. If your library requires runtime dependencies, your new library will not be accepted until the required image has been merged and published to the SDP Pipeline Images repository. Libraries are required a documentation page to be accepted.

The landing page for the SDP Pipeline Libraries has a table that outlines each library and a high-level description of the library. Update this table in docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc.

The Jenkins pipeline-as-code that is developed to perform various tool integrations is largely undifferentiated. That is to say, it doesn’t really matter what project you’re working on - the pipeline code that’s written can be reused anywhere if the configuration is appropriately externalized. These libraries serve as an open source, reusable portfolio of tool integrations that can help us speak a common language and leverage a common framework when implementing CI/CD pipelines. Maintaining tool installations on a Jenkins instance can be a configuration management nightmare. Trying to keep straight 3 different versions of Java, Maven, Ant, Gradle, and so on within your Jenkins instance quickly leads to a bloated and difficult to maintain instance. Furthermore, when tools are installed directly on Jenkins build agents it can be difficult to rapidly introduce new features to the pipeline. We use container images to decouple the Jenkins infrastructure from the tools that the pipeline needs for building, testing, and deploying applications. Each library, rather than direclty invoke a tool, will leverage helpers from the sdp library to execute portions of the pipeline inside of container images. These images can be found in the Booz Allen SDP Images GitHub Repository and are hosted through the GitHub Package Registry. If using the SDP Pipeline Libraries as a Library Source for your pipeline, then you must include the sdp library. This library containers helper functions such as inside_sdp_image() to facilitate the use of the SDP Pipeline Container Images as run time environments. Your Jenkins build agents must have Docker installed due to the above-mentioned use of container images in the SDP Pipeline Libraries. Table 1.

Steps Step Description deploy_to() Performs a deployment using Helm ephemeral(Closure body, ApplicationEnvironment) Creates a short-lived application environment for testing The configurations for the Kubernetes library can be specified in the library spec or on a per application environment. The Kubernetetes Credential is the Jenkins credential defined as a Secrets file that holds the kubeconfig fie contents with access information to the kubernetes target environments. The Kubernetes Context is the context within the kubeconfig that should be used to identify the target environment for deployment. You would specify this as follows: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" k8s_context = \"test\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" k8s_credential = \"cluster1-config\" k8s_context = \"production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ k8s_credential = \"cluster2-config\" k8s_context = \"dev\" } } With this configuration, dev context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to dev and the test context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to test while production context within the cluster1-config would be used when deploying to prod. Together k8s_credential and k8s_context uniquely identify the target environment for deployment. We use Helm for a deployment mechanism to Kubernetes. Helm is a package manager and templating engine for Kubernetes manifests. Using Helm, the typical YAML manifests used to deploy to Kubernetes distributions can be templatized for reuse. In our case, a different values file is used for each static application environment. Create Helm Configuration Repository You’ll need to create a GitHub repository to store the helm chart for your application(s). See the helm docs on provisioning a new chart to get intialize the repository with the skeleton for your chart. How you choose to build your helm chart is up to you, you can put every api object in the templates directory or have subcharts for each individual microservice. SDP doesn’t care, as all it does is clone the github repository and deploy the chart using the specified values file. Values File Conventions Given that we tag container images using the git SHA, SDP will clone your helm configuration repository and update a key corresponding to the current version of each container image for each application environment. As such, a certain syntax is required in your values file. You must have an image_shas key. SDP will automatically add subkeys for each repositories under this image_shas with a value that is the git SHA. Given that YAML keys can’t have hyphens, hyphens in repository names will be replaced with underscores. image_shas: my_sample_application: abcdefgh another_repo: abcdef you can add whatever other keys are necessary to appropriately parameterize your helm chart. Helm Configurations for the Library The helm configuration repository and github credential can be configured globally in the library spec and overriden for specific application environments. The values file to will default to values.${app_env.short_name}.yaml, or can be overridden via app_env.chart_values_file. The name of the release will default to app_env.short_name, or can be overridden via app_env.release_name An example of helm configurations: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" chart_values_file = \"dev_values.yaml\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" release_name = \"banana\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" } } It’s often beneficial to build a container image once, and then promote that image through different application environments. This makes it possible to test the content of an image once in a lower environment, and remain confident that the results of those tests would be the same as an image is promoted. Promoting images also speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, as building a container image is often the most time-consuming part of the pipeline. By default, the deploy_to() step of the kubernetes pipeline library will promote a container image if it can expect one to exist, which is when the most recent code change was a merge into the given code branch. The image would be expected to be built from an earlier commit, or while there was an open PR. You can override this default for the entire pipeline by setting the promote_previous_image config setting to false. You can also choose whether or not to promote images for each application environment individually through the promote_previous_image application_environment setting. This app_env setting takes priority over the config setting. An example of these settings' usage: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" promote_previous_image = false } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" k8s_credential = \"cluster1-config\" k8s_context = \"staging\" promote_previous_image = true //note: making this setting true is redundant, since true is the default } } Table 2.

Q: What’s the difference between explicitlyMockPipelineStep and explicitlyMockPipelineVariable? A: Practically speaking, the difference is you can omit \".call\" for explicitlyMockPipelineStep() when you use getPipelineMock() In the example above, I used explicitlyMockPipelineStep()` to mock error. Because of that, if I want to see if the error pipeline step is run, I use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error\"). If I were to create the mock using explicitlyMockPipelineVariable() I would instead use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error.call\") There may be some additional differences as well, so try to use what makes the most sense Q: What if I don’t know exactly what the parameters are going to be? A: There are ways to match parameters to regex expressions, as well as test parameters individually The standard format for interaction-based tests are * getPipelineMock()() While you can put the exact parameter value in the second parentheses, you can also run arbitrary groovy code inside curly brackets. Whether or not it’s a \"match\" depends on if that code returns true or false. A good example is in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy. Use it to get the value of the parameter. 1 * getPipelineMock(\"sh\")({it =~ / (zap-cli open-url) Kirk (.+)/}) Q: Do I have to do interaction-based testing? A: No, but you can’t get variables the same way as traditional Spock tests This is because the script gets run in that loadPipelineScriptForTest object. You can only access variables stored in the binding, which are few. It makes more sense to see how variables are being used in pipeline steps, and make sure those pipeline steps use the correct value for those variables. Similarly, if you need to control how a variable is set, you need to stub whatever method or pipeline step that sets the initial value for that variable As an example, in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy, the target variable in penetration_test.groovy is tested by checking the parameters to an sh step. Q: I keep getting \"can’t run method foo() on null; what do I do?\" A: You need to find a way to stub the method that sets the value for the object that calls foo() There should be an example in GetImagesToBuildSpec.groovy (in the docker-unit-tests branch at the time of writing) arrow_back Test Execution","title":"FAQ","component":"sdp-libraries","version":"2","name":"faq","url":"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/2/unit_testing/faq.html","titles":[]},"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/2/unit_testing/index.html":{"text":"The purpose of writing unit tests for pipeline libraries is to confirm that they function the way we expect.

Of course, ensure this tool has # from the root of the repository mkdir libraries/ Go on over to JTE’s Library Development documentation to learn how to create libraries. There are a few conventions the SDP Pipeline Libraries have adopted, outlined below: The SDP library exists to implement common functionality required by the other libraries. It’s worthwhile to see if any of those steps are going to be useful to you during library development. The SDP Pipeline Libraries try to install as few plugins on the Jenkins instance and as few tools on the underlying infrastructure as possible. We run portions of the pipeline inside container images, leveraging them as runtime pipeline environments. The existing container images used for this purpose can be found in the SDP Pipeline Images repository. If your library requires runtime dependencies, like a CLI, capture them in a container image and open a PR to the SDP Pipeline Images repository. In your step implementations, the image that is to be used should be overridable but default to the image hosted via GitHub Package Registry on the SDP Pipeline Images repository. If your library requires runtime dependencies, your new library will not be accepted until the required image has been merged and published to the SDP Pipeline Images repository.

The Jenkins pipeline-as-code that is developed to perform various tool integrations is largely undifferentiated. That is to say, it doesn’t really matter what project you’re working on - the pipeline code that’s written can be reused anywhere if the configuration is appropriately externalized. These libraries serve as an open source, reusable portfolio of tool integrations that can help us speak a common language and leverage a common framework when implementing CI/CD pipelines. Maintaining tool installations on a Jenkins instance can be a configuration management nightmare. Trying to keep straight 3 different versions of Java, Maven, Ant, Gradle, and so on within your Jenkins instance quickly leads to a bloated and difficult to maintain instance. Furthermore, when tools are installed directly on Jenkins build agents it can be difficult to rapidly introduce new features to the pipeline. We use container images to decouple the Jenkins infrastructure from the tools that the pipeline needs for building, testing, and deploying applications. Each library, rather than direclty invoke a tool, will leverage helpers from the sdp library to execute portions of the pipeline inside of container images. These images can be found in the Booz Allen SDP Images GitHub Repository and are hosted through the GitHub Package Registry. If using the SDP Pipeline Libraries as a Library Source for your pipeline, then you must include the sdp library. This library containers helper functions such as inside_sdp_image() to facilitate the use of the SDP Pipeline Container Images as run time environments. Your Jenkins build agents must have Docker installed due to the above-mentioned use of container images in the SDP Pipeline Libraries. Table 1.

Steps Step Description deploy_to() Performs a deployment using Helm ephemeral(Closure body, ApplicationEnvironment) Creates a short-lived application environment for testing The configurations for the Kubernetes library can be specified in the library spec or on a per application environment. The Kubernetetes Credential is the Jenkins credential defined as a Secrets file that holds the kubeconfig fie contents with access information to the kubernetes target environments. The Kubernetes Context is the context within the kubeconfig that should be used to identify the target environment for deployment. You would specify this as follows: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" k8s_context = \"test\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" k8s_credential = \"cluster1-config\" k8s_context = \"production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ k8s_credential = \"cluster2-config\" k8s_context = \"dev\" } } With this configuration, dev context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to dev and the test context within the cluster2-config would be used when deploying to test while production context within the cluster1-config would be used when deploying to prod. Together k8s_credential and k8s_context uniquely identify the target environment for deployment. We use Helm for a deployment mechanism to Kubernetes. Helm is a package manager and templating engine for Kubernetes manifests. Using Helm, the typical YAML manifests used to deploy to Kubernetes distributions can be templatized for reuse. In our case, a different values file is used for each static application environment. Create Helm Configuration Repository You’ll need to create a GitHub repository to store the helm chart for your application(s). See the helm docs on provisioning a new chart to get intialize the repository with the skeleton for your chart. How you choose to build your helm chart is up to you, you can put every api object in the templates directory or have subcharts for each individual microservice. SDP doesn’t care, as all it does is clone the github repository and deploy the chart using the specified values file. Values File Conventions Given that we tag container images using the git SHA, SDP will clone your helm configuration repository and update a key corresponding to the current version of each container image for each application environment. As such, a certain syntax is required in your values file. You must have an image_shas key. SDP will automatically add subkeys for each repositories under this image_shas with a value that is the git SHA. Given that YAML keys can’t have hyphens, hyphens in repository names will be replaced with underscores. image_shas: my_sample_application: abcdefgh another_repo: abcdef you can add whatever other keys are necessary to appropriately parameterize your helm chart. Helm Configurations for the Library The helm configuration repository and github credential can be configured globally in the library spec and overriden for specific application environments. The values file to will default to values.${app_env.short_name}.yaml, or can be overridden via app_env.chart_values_file. The name of the release will default to app_env.short_name, or can be overridden via app_env.release_name An example of helm configurations: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Development\" chart_values_file = \"dev_values.yaml\" } test{ short_name = \"test\" long_name = \"Test\" release_name = \"banana\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"Production\" } } libraries{ kubernetes{ helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.boozallencsn.com/Red-Hat-Summit/helm-configuration.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = \"github\" } } It’s often beneficial to build a container image once, and then promote that image through different application environments. This makes it possible to test the content of an image once in a lower environment, and remain confident that the results of those tests would be the same as an image is promoted. Promoting images also speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, as building a container image is often the most time-consuming part of the pipeline. By default, the deploy_to() step of the kubernetes pipeline library will promote a container image if it can expect one to exist, which is when the most recent code change was a merge into the given code branch. The image would be expected to be built from an earlier commit, or while there was an open PR. You can override this default for the entire pipeline by setting the promote_previous_image config setting to false. You can also choose whether or not to promote images for each application environment individually through the promote_previous_image application_environment setting. This app_env setting takes priority over the config setting.

Q: What’s the difference between explicitlyMockPipelineStep and explicitlyMockPipelineVariable? A: Practically speaking, the difference is you can omit \".call\" for explicitlyMockPipelineStep() when you use getPipelineMock() In the example above, I used explicitlyMockPipelineStep()` to mock error. Because of that, if I want to see if the error pipeline step is run, I use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error\"). If I were to create the mock using explicitlyMockPipelineVariable() I would instead use 1 * getPipelineMock(\"error.call\") There may be some additional differences as well, so try to use what makes the most sense Q: What if I don’t know exactly what the parameters are going to be? A: There are ways to match parameters to regex expressions, as well as test parameters individually The standard format for interaction-based tests are * getPipelineMock()() While you can put the exact parameter value in the second parentheses, you can also run arbitrary groovy code inside curly brackets. Whether or not it’s a \"match\" depends on if that code returns true or false. A good example is in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy. Use it to get the value of the parameter. 1 * getPipelineMock(\"sh\")({it =~ / (zap-cli open-url) Kirk (.+)/}) Q: Do I have to do interaction-based testing? A: No, but you can’t get variables the same way as traditional Spock tests This is because the script gets run in that loadPipelineScriptForTest object. You can only access variables stored in the binding, which are few. It makes more sense to see how variables are being used in pipeline steps, and make sure those pipeline steps use the correct value for those variables. Similarly, if you need to control how a variable is set, you need to stub whatever method or pipeline step that sets the initial value for that variable As an example, in PenetrationTestSpec.groovy, the target variable in penetration_test.groovy is tested by checking the parameters to an sh step. Q: I keep getting \"can’t run method foo() on null; what do I do?\" A: You need to find a way to stub the method that sets the value for the object that calls foo() There should be an example in GetImagesToBuildSpec.groovy (in the docker-unit-tests branch at the time of writing) arrow_back Test Execution","title":"FAQ","component":"sdp-libraries","version":"master","name":"faq","url":"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/unit_testing/faq.html","titles":[]},"/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/unit_testing/index.html":{"text":"The purpose of writing unit tests for pipeline libraries is to confirm that they function the way we expect.

To easily see what that subdomain is for your cluster, you can run oc get routes -n default and look at the entries under the HOST/PORT column. It will be everything past the first period (.), so if one of the entries is docker-registry-default.apps.ocp.example.com then values.yaml should contain: global: domain: apps.ocp.example.com You can also add to your values file any of the values described in the sdp-helm-chart repository README. While the SDP installation will deploy SonarQube and other tools, you can opt not to install them by changing their \"enable\" setting from true to false. arrow_back Section 1 - Deploying the DevOps Tools Section 1.2 - Running the Installer Script arrow_forward","title":"Section 1.1 - Preparing to Run the Installer","component":"deployment-guides","version":"1","name":"1_1_Prepare_To_Install","url":"/sdp-docs/deployment-guides/1/openshift/1_1_Prepare_To_Install.html","titles":[{"text":"Log into OpenShift","id":"_log_into_openshift"},{"text":"Clone the sdp-helm-chart Repository","id":"_clone_the_sdp_helm_chart_repository"},{"text":"Create Your Values File","id":"_create_your_values_file"},{"text":"Modify the Values File","id":"_modify_the_values_file"}]},"/sdp-docs/deployment-guides/1/openshift/1_2_Run_Installer.html":{"text":"From the root of the sdp-helm-chart directory, run the command ./installer.sh Supply a GitHub username and password (or access token) when prompted.

Ideally, there’s some source code management tool (SCM) that’s being used to centralize, share, and manage source code. The SDP takes advantage of these features of SCMs in your CI/CD pipelines. Currently, the preferred SCM is GitHub, which is where the SDP keeps and maintains its source code. A basic DevSecOps, CI/CD Pipeline will do three things: build, deploy, and test. It should take the raw source code and change it to a format that will run optimally on your platform. It should also take the output of the build and deploy it to your platform. Lastly it should be automatically testing various aspects of the application and all throughout the pipeline - anything from unit tests to penetration tests. There are myriad ways to do any of these three tasks, but because it’s assumed you’ll be deploying on OpenShift we can make some assumptions about your pipeline. Since OpenShift is a container application platform, and it’s assumed that your application is being deployed to OpenShift, it can also be assumed that your application running as (Docker) containers. The SDP’s Docker Library makes it easy to build images from your source code repository and store them in OpenShift’s built-in container registry. OpenShift has some guidelines around creating container images that it’s important to be aware of. The section on supporting arbitrary user IDs is especially important. The SDP currently has libraries for tools that run code quality tests, accessibility compliance (508) tests, penetration tests, and more. Which ones you should use depends on the needs of your application. Automated tests like these are useful for detecting issues earlier in a feature’s lifecycle, where it’s easier (and cheaper) to correct. The OpenShift Library makes it easy to deploy to different OpenShift projects using Helm, a Kubernetes/OpenShift package manager and templating tool. How to deploy an application is defined in a Helm chart or charts, which is maintained in your SCM alongside your source code and pipeline configuration.

This guide should provide a good foundation to build off of. This page covers the creation of a simple pipeline configuration repository, a repository containing files that define one or more pipelines, with a single governance tier in the root. You can learn more about pipeline goverance here. Use an SCM like GitHub to create a repository to store your pipeline configuration. This way you can access, share, and maintain pipeline configuration like any other piece of code. At the root of this repository create a file called Jenkinsfile. This is the default pipeline template. A simple pipeline template might look like this: static_code_analysis() build() on_merge to: develop, { deploy_to dev } on_merge to: master, { deploy_to prod } You can learn more about writing pipeline templates here Also at the root of your pipeline configuration repository, create a file called pipeline_config.groovy. Since this file will (likely) be in your global governance tier, you modify it to make changes that apply to every pipeline. A simple pipeline config file might look like this: application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Develop\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"prod\" } } keywords{ master = /^[Mm]aster$/ develop = /^[Dd]evelop$/ } libraries{ github_enterprise sonarqube docker{ registry = \"docker-registry.default.svc:5000\" cred = \"openshift-docker-registry\" repo_path_prefix = \"my-app-images\" } sdp{ images{ registry = \"https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000\" repo = \"sdp\" cred = \"openshift-docker-registry\" } } openshift{ // More on these settings in the next section url = \"https://my-openshift-cluster.ocp.example.com:8443\" helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.com/kottoson-bah/sdp-example-helm-config.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = github tiller_namespace = my-app-tiller tiller_credential = my-app-tiller-credential } } You can learn more about writing pipeline config files here The pipeline defined by this example won’t work until you’ve finished setting up your application environments in OpenShift and written your helm configuration repository, which is covered in the next section. This section explains how the example pipeline template and pipeline config file above work together to create a pipeline. Starting with the pipeline template, every pipeline created from this template will have these steps: static_code_analysis() // 1) Check the source code for bugs & code smells build() // 2) Build an artifact from the source code on_merge to: develop, {// 3a) if a merge to the develop branch triggered the build... deploy_to dev // 3b) deploy the application to the \"dev\" environment } on_merge to: master, {// 4a) if a merge to the master branch triggered the build... deploy_to prod // 4b) deploy the application to the \"prod\" environment } Now that the pipeline template has defined what the pipeline does, there needs libraries to be a pipeline config file to define how. It needs to provide the implementation for the pipeline steps, application environments to define the dev and prod environments being deployed to, and keywords for the variables develop and master being used. libraries{ github_enterprise sonarqube docker{ registry = \"docker-registry.default.svc:5000\" cred = \"openshift-docker-registry\" repo_path_prefix = \"my-app-images\" } sdp{ images{ registry = \"https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000\" repo = \"sdp\" cred = \"openshift-docker-registry\" } } openshift{ // More on these settings in the next section url = \"https://my-openshift-cluster.ocp.example.com:8443\" helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.com/kottoson-bah/sdp-example-helm-config.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = github tiller_namespace = my-app-tiller tiller_credential = my-app-tiller-credential } } For every step used in a pipeline template, something needs to define that step’s implementation. For the JTE, these step implementations most commonly come from \"libraries\", which are imported from a \"library source\". For this example pipeline, it’s assumed that the sdp-libraries library source is available, and any of the libraries it contains can be used. Five libraries are being imported here: github_enterprise, sonarqube, docker, sdp, and OpenShift. Below is a mapping of steps to the libraries that are being used. static_code_analysis() // sonarqube build() // docker on_merge to: develop, {// github_enterprise deploy_to dev // openshift } on_merge to: master, {// github_enterprise deploy_to prod // openshift } Although the sdp library doesn’t provide the implementation for any of the steps here, it’s being imported because both the SonarQube and OpenShift libraries depend on a step it defines. You can learn more about the SDP pipeline libraries here application_environments{ dev{ short_name = \"dev\" long_name = \"Develop\" } prod{ short_name = \"prod\" long_name = \"prod\" } } The OpenShift library uses Application Environment primitives to select which project in OpenShift to deploy to. For example, when the pipeline template calls deploy to: dev(which can also be read as deploy(to: dev)), it takes the dev application environment primitive object that we define here and uses its values in the deploy_to step. The short_name, in particular, is used to select the target OpenShift project and which values.yaml file to use as part of the deployment. View the next section or the OpenShift library page for more details. keywords{ master = /^[Mm]aster$/ develop = /^[Dd]evelop$/ } The GitHub Enterprise library uses Keyword primitives to determine what kind of GitHub branch is being built. The steps on_merge(), on_commit, and on_pull_request take a regex expression as a parameter. These regex expressions have been stored as keywords to make the pipeline template more human-readable. This pipeline configuration repository, with a single governance tier located in the base of the repository, contains two files: Jenkinsfile and pipeline_config.groovy. The default pipeline template, Jenkinsfile, defines the steps that each pipeline executes. The pipeline configuration file, pipeline_config.groovy, controls how those steps are run in the pipeline by selecting the libraries to implement those steps, the settings for those libraries, and any other pipeline primitives being used. Using the files in this example, pipelines will: test the source code using SonarQube build & push a Docker container image depending on the pipeline trigger, deploy that container on OpenShift You should be ready to move onto the next section, which covers creating a Helm chart repository.

It’s an arbitrary name that makes it possible to distinguish your application from others that may share the same cluster. This prefix is ideally an abbreviation of your project name. In the example above, the prefix for the \"RedHat Summit\" project is \"rhs.\" You need to know how many environments you want, as well as abbreviated names for each. These abbreviated names are placed after -e in the script’s options. In the example above, there are four environments being provisioned: dev, test, staging, and prod. The script will create an OpenShift project for each one: rhs-dev, rhs-test, rhs-staging, and rhs-prod. These abbreviated names map to the application environments \"short names\" of the in your pipeline configuration file(s). You also need a name for the project hosting the container images. This is the full name of the project and will not necessarily include the prefix (unlike the other projects being created). In the example above, that project is called \"red-hat-summit\". Putting it all together, execute the provision_app_envs script, using the appropriate flags to provide the three pieces of information covered above. $ bash provision_app_envs.sh -p $PREFIX -e $ENV_1 -e $ENV_2 ... -e $ENV_N -i $IMAGE_PROJ The script should take care of the rest, creating and setting up projects for the application environments, images, and tiller server.

Helm is a tool for templating and managing Kubernetes configuration files and, by extension, OpenShift configuration files. Any element in OpenShift can be expressed as as yaml or JSON. Helm lets you take that yaml and organize it, turn them into a template, and, through tiller, use them to deploy to your cluster. This Helm chart repository is what the OpenShift SDP library will use to deploy your application to OpenShift. In it, you should create a Helm chart that defines the various DeploymentConfigs, Services, Routes, and other objects your application needs to function. Use an SCM like GitHub to create a repository to store your Helm chart. This way you can access, share and maintain the Helm chart like any other piece of code. Name it whatever you like, but helm-configuration-repository makes sense. It can be public or private, so long as the GitHub account Jenkins is using can read from it and write back to it. Assuming you’ve created an empty GitHub repository for your helm chart, you can run: helm create cd git remote add origin git add --all git commit -m \"initializing chart repo\" git push -u origin master Once that’s done you should Delete the yaml files that were automatically created when helm create was called. These are example helm templates, and we don’t need them. Delete the contents of templates/_helpers.tpl and templates/NOTES.txt. We want to keep those files, but provide our own content. Update Chart.yaml to properly describe your new chart. For more information on Helm charts, check out the [Helm documentation]. SDP pushes and pulls to this chart repository to keep it up to date with the image tags of deployed containers. For each application repository that SDP will be building, add a key under image_shas in values.yaml. If there is no image_shas key, create one. As an example, if there was a repository called sample-app, your values.yaml would include: image_shas: sample_app: Because YAML key’s cannot contain hyphens, the openshift converts them to underscores and expects that value under image_shas Your template would then be able to specify the image for a deployment via: image: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/demo/sample-app:{{ .Values.image_shas.sample_app }} At this point, you should take some time to finish fleshing out your Helm chart to reflect how you wish to deploy your app. The Helm documentation on writing charts and templates is a good place to start learning how to create your helm chart. There are a few additional tips that are useful for writing charts and templates for OpenShift. The first useful tip is that it’s possible to create objects in OpenShift using the web console, and then view its corresponding yaml file either by using the \"edit YAML\" option or using the OpenShift CLI. The challenge is identifying and deleting fields that are automatically generated by the cluster or added by default. This removes unnecessary clutter from the template and, in the case of automatically generated fields such as the resourceVersion, prevents errors in the cluster. $ oc get all -o yaml The second useful tip, which mostly applies if you are copying YAML files from OpenShift, is that the apiVersion field for OpenShift-exclusive object types need to be modified for Helm to process the template correctly. Refer to the table in this OpenShift blog post mapping the object types, Kind, to the appropriate apiVersion. The third tip is knowing that each container being deployed likely needs at least three things: a DeploymentConfig, a Service, and a Route. The DeploymentConfig manages creating and running the container, the Service makes it possible to connect to that container within the cluster, and the Route exposes that service so it can be connected to from outside the cluster. You can see example templates for each of these in the sdp-helm-chart repository, which is itself a Helm chart. In addition to the values.yaml file created when helm create was run, you need a values..yaml file for each application environment you created when running provision_app_envs.sh. Be sure to substitute with the \"short_name\" of the application environment. For example, if you created a dev and prod environment, you might create those files with the command: cp values.yaml values.prod.yaml] The purpose of these separate files is so that you can provide separate configurations (database URLs, names, etc.) for different environments. Now, whenever you use the deploy_to dev step in your pipeline, it will deploy a helm chart using values.dev.yaml. The SDP will automatically update the image sha value discussed earlier, but you should now modify the different values files with their environment-specifc variables. If you recall from earlier in this guide, in the page on the Pipeline Configuration Repository, there were some settings for the OpenShift SDP library that may not have been clear before this point in the guide. libraries{ //... openshift{ url = \"https://my-openshift-cluster.ocp.example.com:8443\" helm_configuration_repository = \"https://github.com/kottoson-bah/sdp-example-helm-config.git\" helm_configuration_repository_credential = github tiller_namespace = my-app-tiller tiller_credential = my-app-tiller-credential } } Here’s what you should now put for each of these settings Table 1.
