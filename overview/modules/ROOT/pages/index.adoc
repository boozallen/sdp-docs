= Solutions Delivery Platform

The some random change Solutions Delivery Platform (SDP) is an accumulation of Booz Allen's
lessons learned implementing DevSecOps practices across multiple client
projects and RFP Tech Challenges.

At Booz Allen, DevSecOps is a foundational element of our Modern
Software development Approach

Over the past two years, we've developed an open source and reusable
pipeline framework that jump starts projects. SDP has allowed the
typical time to develop a pipeline from 3 to 4 months down to just a
week.

Instead of creating per-application pipelines, SDP allows you to create
tool-agnostic, templated workflows that can be used by multiple teams to
achieve organizational governance.

== Components

=== Container Orchestration Platform

The container orchestration platform, typically a kubernetes based
solution, is responsible for hosting the DevOps tools; such as Jenkins
or SonarQube.

[NOTE]
====
There is no strict dependency on OpenShift or Kubernetes, though this
will enable a more robust platform.
====

=== Jenkins Templating Engine

The Jenkins Templating Engine is a custom plugin written by Booz Allen
that enables the capabilities of the Solutions Delivery Platform; such
as organizational governance through templating and hierarchical
configuration files.

[NOTE]
====
This plugin is available in the Jenkins Update Center under the name
https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine[Templating Engine Plugin].
====

=== SDP Pipeline Libraries

The SDP Pipeline Libraries are our reusable tool integrations that
contain the actual technical implementations of pipeline actions; such
as static code analysis, penetration testing, and deployments.

=== DevSecOps Dashboard

Your DevSeCops pipeline is able to observe everything about software
delivery for your project or organization. Through SDP, you would be
able to aggregate these metrics into a DevSecOps dashboard to enable
continuous improvement of your processes.
